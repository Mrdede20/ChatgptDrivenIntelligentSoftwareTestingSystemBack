Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here's an example:

```
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
x = 2
print(find_in_sorted(arr, x))  # Output: 1
```

In the first implementation, `find_in_sorted` returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `arr`. In this case, it returns `1`.

In the second implementation, `binsearch` returns the index of any occurrence of `x` in `arr`. In this case, it returns `2`.

Therefore, the two implementations will have different output for this input.
