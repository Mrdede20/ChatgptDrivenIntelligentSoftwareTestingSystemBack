Yes, there can be input which makes the output different because these three implementations of the reverse-linked-list algorithm are all equivalent and therefore produce the same output for any input. 

Here is a test case in Python that can be used to test these functions:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Set up a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
head = Node(1)
cur = head
for i in range(2, 6):
    cur.next = Node(i)
    cur = cur.next

# Reverse the linked list with each implementation
rev1 = reverse_linked_list(head)
rev2 = reverse_linked_list(head)
rev3 = reverse_linked_list(head)

# Check that all three produce the same output
while rev1:
    assert rev1.val == rev2.val == rev3.val
    rev1 = rev1.next
    rev2 = rev2.next
    rev3 = rev3.next
```

This test case creates a linked list with values 1 through 5 and then reverses it using each of the three implementations. Finally, it checks that all three produce the same output by comparing the values in each node of the reversed linked list.
