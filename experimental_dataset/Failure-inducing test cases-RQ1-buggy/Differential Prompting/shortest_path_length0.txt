Yes, the two programs have different implementations despite serving the same purpose of implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for finding a shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph. There are differences in the data structures, functions and operations being used. 

The first program uses a FibHeap containing (node, distance) pairs to track unvisited nodes and their distances from the startnode. Its "insert_or_update" function checks if a node is already in the heap before deciding whether to update the existing node's distance or insert a new node.

The second program uses a simple list of tuples (heap) containing (cost, node) pairs to track unvisited nodes and their costs so far from the startnode. Its "dijkstras_shortest_path" function updates the cost of a node rather than adding a new node in the heap, as soon as it is discovered or sooner if a better path to it is found later.

Both programs use the heapq module for efficient heap operations (heappush, heappop) and have the same time complexity of O(E log V) for processing E edges and V vertices of the graph. However, the FibHeap implementation may have better amortized time complexity especially for dense graphs, due to its more efficient extract-min and decrease-key operations.
