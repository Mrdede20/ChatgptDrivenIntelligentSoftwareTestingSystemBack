Yes, there is at least one input that makes the two programs have different output. 

Here is a test case:
```
n = 3
print(pascal(n))
```
This test case will output the following for the first implementation:
```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
```
And the following for the second implementation:
```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]
```
As you can see, the second implementation produces an additional row in the Pascal's triangle. This is because the second implementation adds a check for `i > 0` while the first implementation does not.
