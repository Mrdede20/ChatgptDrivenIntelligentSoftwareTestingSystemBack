Yes, there is an input that can produce different outputs for the two versions of the `bucketsort()` function. 

Here's an example input that will produce different outputs:

```
arr = [1, 3, 2, 1]
k = 4
```

For the first version of `bucketsort()`, the sorted array returned will be `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. 

For the second version of `bucketsort()`, the sorted array returned will be `[0, 1, 2, 1]`. 

This is because the second version is using the `arr` list to loop through and increment the counts, whereas the first version is using the actual key value (`x`) to do this. In the second version, since the loop variable (`i`) is used to construct the sorted array, the counts are being inserted in the wrong order, leading to a different sorted array output.
