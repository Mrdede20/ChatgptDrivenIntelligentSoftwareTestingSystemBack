No, all four implementations of `max_sublist_sum` have the same logic for finding the maximum subarray sum. The only difference is in the order of arguments in the `max` function and the initial values of `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`. The final implementation uses the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum which has a time complexity of O(n).
