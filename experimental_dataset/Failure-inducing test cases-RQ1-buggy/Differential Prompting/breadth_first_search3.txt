Yes, the two programs can have different output for input where startnode and goalnode have the same reference in memory but are not the same object. Here's an example:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.successors = []

a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)
a.successors.append(b)
b.successors.append(a)

print(breadth_first_search(a, b))  # Returns True for the original code but False for the last version
```

In this example, `a` and `b` have the same successor (each other). In the original code, the check `if node is goalnode` compares them by identity, so it returns True. In the last version, the check `if node == goalnode` compares them by value, so it returns False.
