Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is the test case:

```
arr = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
```

The first implementation will return 3, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence [2, 3, 5]. The second implementation will return 4, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence [1, 2, 3, 5].
