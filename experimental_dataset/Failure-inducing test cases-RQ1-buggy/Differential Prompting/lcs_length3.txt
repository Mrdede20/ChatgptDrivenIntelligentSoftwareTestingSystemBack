Yes, there are some inputs that can make the two programs have different outputs. This can happen when there are repeated characters in the input strings. Here's an example input:

```
s = "aab"
t = "aba"
```

The output of the first program `lcs_length(s, t)` would be `2`, while the output of the second program `lcs_length(s, t)` would be `1`. The reason for the difference is that the first program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) for all possible substring pairs, while the second program uses a 2D array `dp` to keep track of the length of the LCS for each prefix of `s` and `t`. 

When `s[i] == t[j]`, the first program keeps track of the length of the LCS for the substrings `s[:i+1]` and `t[j+1]`, while the second program keeps track of the length of the LCS for the prefixes `s[:i+1]` and `t[:j+1]`.

In the given example input, the first program computes `dp[(1, 1)]` and `dp[(2, 2)]`, both of which are equal to `2`, while the second program only computes `dp[2][2]` which is equal to `1`.
