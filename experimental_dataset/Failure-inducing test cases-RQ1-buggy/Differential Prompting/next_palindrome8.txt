Yes, there is an input that could make the two programs produce different outputs. Here is a test case in Python:

```
digit_list = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]  # A list of 7 nines

# Output of first function:
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
# Output of second function:
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

The first program will return a palindrome with 8 digits, while the second program will return a palindrome with 10 digits. This is because the second program checks if the input list is already the maximum possible palindrome and adds two extra digits if it is, while the first program assumes that the input list is not the maximum possible palindrome and adds only one extra digit.
