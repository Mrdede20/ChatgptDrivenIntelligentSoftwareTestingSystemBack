Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. 

For example, consider the input array `arr = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]` and `k = 1`. The function `kth(arr, k)` will return 2 as the output, which is the 1st smallest element in the array. However, the function `kth_smallest_element(arr, k)` will return 1 as the output, which is the 1st element in the array. 

Here's the code to test this input:

```
arr = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
k = 1

print(kth(arr, k))  # Output: 2
print(kth_smallest_element(arr, k))  # Output: 1
```
