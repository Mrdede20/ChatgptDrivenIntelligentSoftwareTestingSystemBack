Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here's an example:

```python
arr = [1, 4, 1, 4]
k = 5
print(bucketsort(arr, k))
```

With the first implementation, the output will be `[1, 1, 4, 4]`, while with the second implementation the output will be `[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]`. This is because the second implementation iterates over `arr` instead of `counts` in the second for loop, causing `i` to take on the values in `arr` instead of the values in `counts`.
