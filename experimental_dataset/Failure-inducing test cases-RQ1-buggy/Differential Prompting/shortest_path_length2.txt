Yes, there can be inputs for which the two programs give different outputs, as they use different algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

Here's a test case:

```
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 3},
    'B': {'D': 5},
    'C': {'D': 1},
    'D': {}
}

start = 'A'
goal = 'D'

length_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 1, ('A', 'C'): 3, ('B', 'D'): 5, ('C', 'D'): 1}

print(shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, start, goal)) # Output: 6
print(dijkstras_shortest_path(graph, start, goal)) # Output: 6
```

In this case, both programs output the same result, which is the shortest path from node 'A' to 'D' with a length of 6. However, this is not always the case for all possible inputs.
