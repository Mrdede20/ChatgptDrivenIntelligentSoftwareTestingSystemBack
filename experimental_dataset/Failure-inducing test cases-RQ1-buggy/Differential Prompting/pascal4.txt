Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here's a test case:

```
n = 3
print(pascal(n))
```

The first `pascal` function will return `[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`, while the second `pascal` function will return `[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1, 1]]`. The second implementation adds an extra `1` to the end of the third row, but the first implementation does not.
