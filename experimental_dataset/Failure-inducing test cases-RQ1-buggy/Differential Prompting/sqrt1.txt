Yes, there is an input which would make the two programs output different results. This input is a negative number. Here's an example test case in Python:

```
print(sqrt(-4, 0.0001))  # Output should be a complex number for the second program, but an error will occur for the first program.
```

The reason for this difference is that the first program uses exponentiation (`**`) to calculate the square of `approx`, which works for negative numbers, while the second program uses multiplication (`*`), which does not work for negative numbers and results in a `ValueError` when trying to take the square root of a negative number.
