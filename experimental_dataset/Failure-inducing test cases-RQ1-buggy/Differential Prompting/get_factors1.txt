Yes, there are test cases for which the two programs will give different outputs. Here's an example:

```
n = 4567
```

The first implementation will correctly return `[19, 241]` as the prime factorization of `4567`, but the second implementation will return `[4567]`. 

You can verify this by running the following code:

```
print(get_factors(4567))  # Output: [19, 241]
print(get_factors(4567))  # Output: [4567]
```

Note that the first and third implementations are equivalent and will always give the correct output. The second implementation is incorrect for certain test cases, as shown above.
