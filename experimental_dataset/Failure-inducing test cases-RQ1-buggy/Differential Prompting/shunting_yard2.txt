Yes, different input can make the two programs output different results. This is because the two programs have different variable names and order of operations. For example, if we use the input `[2, '*', 3, '+', 4]`, the first program outputs `[2, 3, '*', 4, '+']`, while the second program outputs `[2, 3, '*', 4, '+']`. However, if we use the input `['*', 2, '+', 3, 4]`, the first program outputs `['*', 2, 3, 4, '+']`, while the second program outputs `[2, 3, '+', 4, '*']`.
