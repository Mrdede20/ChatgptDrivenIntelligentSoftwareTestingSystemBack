Yes, there exist inputs that can make the two programs have different output. Here is an example input:

arr = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

For this input, the first program would return 3, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence [1, 2, 5]. However, the second program would return 4, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence [1, 2, 4, 5].
