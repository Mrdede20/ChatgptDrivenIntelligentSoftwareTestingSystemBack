Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs return different output. 

Here's an input where the two programs will have different outputs:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

If we run both programs with this input, we see that the output is different:
```
# Program 1
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2], [3, 4], [3], [4], []]

# Program 2
[[], [4], [3], [3, 4], [2], [2, 4], [2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [1], [1, 4], [1, 3], [1, 3, 4], [1, 2], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

As we can see, the ordering of the subsets is not the same in the two programs. This is because the order in which we concatenate the two lists in the second program is different from the first one.
