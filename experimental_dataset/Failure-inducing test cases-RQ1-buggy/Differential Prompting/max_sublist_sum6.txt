Yes, there are inputs that can generate different outputs for the given programs. Here's an example input: 

```
arr = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9]
```

For this input, the first three implementations of `max_sublist_sum` will return `9`, while the fourth implementation (which is the corrected implementation) will return `11`.
