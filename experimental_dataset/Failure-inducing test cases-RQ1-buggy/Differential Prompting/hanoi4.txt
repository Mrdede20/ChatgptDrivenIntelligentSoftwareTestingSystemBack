Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs output different results, specifically when the height is equal or greater than 3. Here is an example:

```
height = 3
start = 1
end = 2

hanoi(height, start, end)  # output: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)]

hanoi_optimized(height, start, end)  # output: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
```

As you can see, the two programs output different sequences of moves for the same input.
