Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs produce different output.

Here's a test case:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

The first program will output:
```
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

The second program will output:
```
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []]
```

As you can see, the order of the subsets is different in each program.
