Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is a test case in python that will demonstrate the difference:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.successor = None
        
n1 = Node(1)
n2 = Node(2)
n1.successor = n2
n2.successor = n1

print(detect_cycle(n1)) # Output: True
```

In the first program, it will detect a cycle because it checks if hare.successor is None before checking hare.successor.successor is None. In the second program, it will not detect a cycle because it checks hare.successor.successor is None before checking hare.successor is None.
