Yes, there is an input that will make the two programs have different outputs. The programs have different base cases for the length of the input array. The first program has a base case of `len(arr) <= 1`, while the second program has a base case of `len(arr) == 0 or len(arr) == 1`. Alternatively, the third program has a base case of `len(arr) < 2`. 

To create an input that produces different outputs, we can choose an input array that has a length greater than 1 but less than 3. For example:

```
arr = [5, 3]
```

When `merge_sort(arr)` is called with this input, the first program will return `[3, 5]` while the second and third programs will return `[5, 3]`. The fourth program will return `[3, 5]`, because it has a base case of `len(arr) <= 1`, which is the same as the first program.
