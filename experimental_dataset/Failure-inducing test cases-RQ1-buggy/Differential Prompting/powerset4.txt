No, there is no input that can make the two versions of `powerset` have different output since all three versions implement the same logic to calculate the powerset of an array. 

You can verify this by testing the three functions with different input arrays, and they should produce the same output. You can use the following test case in Python to verify:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(powerset(arr))
```

Running this test case with the three versions of `powerset` should produce the same output: 

```
[[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
```
