Yes, there is an input that can make the first three versions of the function have different output from the fourth version. 

Here is the test case in Python:

```python
arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 5]
x = 2

print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))
```

- The first three versions of the function will return -1, indicating that 2 is not in the array.
- The fourth version of the function will also return -1.
- In all versions of the function, if the target x is not in the array, then the function returns -1.
