Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs output different results. This input is `s = 'aabbb'` and `t = 'bbbaa'`. 

The first program uses a dictionary to store the length of the longest common subsequence at each pair of indices (i, j) in s and t. The second program uses a 2D list to achieve the same result. However, the order in which the pairs of indices are looped through is different in the two programs, which can lead to different results for specific inputs. 

In this case, the first program would return 3 (for the lcs 'abb'), while the second program would return 2 (for the lcs 'ab').
