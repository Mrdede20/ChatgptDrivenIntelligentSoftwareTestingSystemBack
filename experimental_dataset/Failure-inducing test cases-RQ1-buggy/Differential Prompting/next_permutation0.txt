No, there is no input that would make the two programs have different output. Both the first and the second versions of the `next_permutation` function implement the same algorithm to generate the next lexicographic permutation of a list of integers. The only difference between the two programs is the condition in the inner loop that selects the index `j` for swapping with `i`. The first version uses `if perm[i] < perm[j]:`, and the second version uses `if perm[j] <= perm[i]:`. However, the order of the elements in the permutation is preserved by both conditions. Therefore, the output of the two functions would be the same for any input.
