Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different outputs. Here's a test case that demonstrates this:

s = "ABB"
t = "BAA"

With the first implementation, `lcs_length(s,t)` returns 1, while the second implementation returns 0. The correct answer is 1, as the longest common subsequence between "ABB" and "BAA" is "B". 

Note that the first implementation uses a dictionary (Counter) to store the results of previous subproblems, while the second implementation uses a 2D list. This can lead to differences in results for some inputs, particularly if the strings are long and the longest common subsequence is short.
