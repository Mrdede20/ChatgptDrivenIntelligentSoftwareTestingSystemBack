No, there is no input that creates a different output for these two programs. 

The functions `find_in_sorted` in both programs call the `binsearch` function with the same arguments and return the same value. The only difference is the implementation of the `binsearch` function, but their outputs are equivalent for any input.

Here's a test case you can use to verify this:

```
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
x = 5

assert find_in_sorted(arr, x) == 2
``` 

Running this test case on both programs should produce the same output.
