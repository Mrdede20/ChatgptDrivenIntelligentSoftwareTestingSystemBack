Yes, there are inputs that can make these two programs have different outputs. The difference is due to the order in which the nodes are added to the output list.

For example, consider the following directed graph:

    A --> B

    C --> B

In the first implementation, if the input nodes are listed as [A, B, C], the output will be [A, C, B], whereas the second implementation will produce the output [B, A, C].

To test this, you can create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the nodes as described above and pass it to both implementations. Here's some sample code that demonstrates this:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.incoming_nodes = set()
        self.outgoing_nodes = set()

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.name

# Create nodes
A = Node("A")
B = Node("B")
C = Node("C")

# Set up edges
A.outgoing_nodes.add(B)
C.outgoing_nodes.add(B)
B.incoming_nodes.add(A)
B.incoming_nodes.add(C)

# Test both implementations
print(topological_ordering([A, B, C]))  # Output: [A, C, B]
print(topological_ordering_v2([A, B, C]))  # Output: [B, A, C]
```
