No, the two programs are exactly the same. Both of them define the `flatten` function in exactly the same way. Defining a function with the same name twice in the same module will simply overwrite the previous definition of that function. Therefore, the second definition overwrites the first one and the `flatten` function in the second program is exactly the same as the `flatten` function in the first program.
