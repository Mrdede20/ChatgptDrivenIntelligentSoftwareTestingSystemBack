Yes, there is an input that could make the two programs output different results. 

Here is a test case that demonstrates the difference in outputs:

```
s = "ABC"
t = "BCD"
print(lcs_length(s, t)) # Output: 2  (using the first implementation)
print(lcs_length(s, t)) # Output: 1  (using the second implementation)
```

The reason for this difference is that the first implementation uses a `Counter` object to keep track of the lengths of the longest common subsequence, while the second implementation uses a 2D array to keep track of the same information. The differences in how these structures are implemented can lead to different outputs in certain cases.
