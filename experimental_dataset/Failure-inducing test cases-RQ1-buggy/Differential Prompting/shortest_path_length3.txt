Yes, the two programs could potentially have different output for certain inputs. This is because the two programs use different data structures to store and process the graph information.

The `shortest_path_length` function uses a FibHeap data structure to keep track of unvisited nodes sorted by distance. The `dijkstras_shortest_path` function uses a regular list heap data structure to keep track of unvisited nodes sorted by their total cost.

The difference in data structures used could potentially result in differences in running time and memory usage for different graphs. Additionally, the graph could be represented differently in each program, meaning that certain edge cases or odd graph topologies could give different results.
