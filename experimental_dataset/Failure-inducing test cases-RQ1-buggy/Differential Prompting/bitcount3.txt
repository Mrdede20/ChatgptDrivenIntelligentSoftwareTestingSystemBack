No, there is no input that will make the two programs have different output for all input values of `n`. This is because both functions ultimately count the number of set bits (bits that are 1) in the binary representation of `n`, but they use different methods to achieve this result. 

For any input value `n`, both functions will always return the same number of set bits in the binary representation of `n`. Therefore, there is no test case to demonstrate different output values for the two programs.
