Yes, there is an input that would make the two programs have different output. 

Test case: `n = 3`

The first program will output `[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]`. 

The second program will output `[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]`. 

The two programs produce different outputs because the second program calculates one more row than the first program.
