Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs output different results. 

Here is a test case that can be used to demonstrate the difference:

```
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
k = 4
```

If you run `kth(arr, k)` with this input, you will get `4`, which is the 4th smallest element in the list.

However, if you run `kth_smallest_element(arr, k)` with the same input, you will get `3`, which is the 4th smallest distinct element in the list.

This is because `kth()` includes duplicates when counting elements, whereas `kth_smallest_element()` only counts distinct elements.
