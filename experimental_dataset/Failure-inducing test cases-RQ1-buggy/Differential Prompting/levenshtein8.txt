Yes, there are possible inputs that can make the two programs have different outputs. 

Here's a test case you can use:

```
source = 'book'
target = 'bek'
```

The first implementation returns a Levenshtein distance of 3, while the second implementation returns a Levenshtein distance of 2. 

In the first implementation, the minimum distance is achieved by deleting the first 'o' in 'book' and substituting 'o' with 'e'. 

In the second implementation, the minimum distance is achieved by deleting the 'o' and 'o' in 'book' and substituting 'o' with 'e'.
