Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here's a test case in Python:

```
text = "hello world my name is bot"
cols = 10

# First program's output:
# ['hello', 'world my', 'name is', 'bot']

# Second program's output:
# ['hello', 'world my', 'name is bot']
```

In this example, the first program splits the text into lines based on the last occurrence of a space character within a range of 10 characters, while the second program splits the text into lines based on the last occurrence of a space character within exactly 10 characters. Therefore, the second program includes the word "bot" in the third line, while the first program splits it between the third and fourth lines.
