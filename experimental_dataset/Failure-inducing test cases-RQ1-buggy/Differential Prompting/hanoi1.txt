Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output.

Test case:
```
hanoi(3, 1, 2)
```

The first program will return the following steps:
```
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2)]
```

The second program will return the following steps:
```
[(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)]
```

The order of the steps are different in both programs, even though they solve the same problem. This is because the first program uses recursion and the second program uses a stack.
