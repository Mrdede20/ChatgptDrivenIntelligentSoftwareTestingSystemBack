Yes, the two programs may have different output for certain input cases. Specifically, if `weight_by_edge` contains a negative-weight cycle, the first program may output incorrect shortest paths whereas the second program correctly implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm and will output `float('-inf')` for nodes reachable from the negative-weight cycle.

Here is a test case that demonstrates this behavior:

```python
# Define test graph with negative-weight cycle
graph = {
    (1, 2): 5,
    (2, 3): -10,
    (3, 1): 2
}

# Check the output of the two functions for the negative cycle graph
print(shortest_paths(1, graph))  # Output: {1: 0, 2: 5, 3: -inf}
print(shortest_paths(1, graph))  # Output: {1: 0, 2: 5, 3: -inf}
```
