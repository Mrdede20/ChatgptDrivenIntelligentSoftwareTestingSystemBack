Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs output different results. 

Here's a test case that demonstrates the difference:

```
s = "AAABBB"
t = "ABAABBA"
```

The first implementation uses a `Counter` to keep track of the LCS length for all pairs of prefixes of `s` and `t`. The second implementation uses a 2D table to do the same thing. When the two implementations try to find the LCS length of `s` and `t` using this test case, they will have different maximum values stored in their respective data structures. 

The first implementation would return 3, while the second implementation would return 4.
