Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Here's the test case you requested:

```
n = 3
```

The first program will return:

```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
```

while the second program will return:

```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]
```

Therefore, the two programs give different output for n=3.
