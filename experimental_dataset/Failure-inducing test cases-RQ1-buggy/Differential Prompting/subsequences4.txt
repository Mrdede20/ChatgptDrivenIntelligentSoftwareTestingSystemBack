Yes, there can be inputs that produce different output for these two programs.

A possible input that produces different output is:

```python
subsequences(1, 3, 2)
```

The first program will return:

```python
[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
```

while the second program will return:

```python
[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
``` 

However, there are other inputs that might produce different output for the two programs. Therefore, it is always important to test the programs under various input conditions.
