Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. 

Test Case:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]

The first implementation will return 4, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.

The second implementation will return 3, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
