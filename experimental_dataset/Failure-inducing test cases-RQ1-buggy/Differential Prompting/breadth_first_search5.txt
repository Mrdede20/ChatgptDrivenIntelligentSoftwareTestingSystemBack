Yes, the third program has a different comparison operator in the line `if node == goalnode:` instead of `if node is goalnode:` used in the first two programs. The `is` keyword checks if the two variables refer to the same object while the `==` operator checks if the two variables have the same value. Therefore, if the `goalnode` is an object that is equal to another object but not the same object (e.g., two lists with the same values), the first two programs would return True while the third program would return False. Here's a Python test case to demonstrate this:

```
n1 = [1, 2]
n2 = [1, 2]
startnode = n1
goalnode = n2

print(breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode))  # Returns True with the first two programs, False with the third program
```
