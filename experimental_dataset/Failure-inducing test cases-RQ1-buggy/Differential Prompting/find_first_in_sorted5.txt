Yes, these four implementations of `find_first_in_sorted` behave differently for the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]` and looking for the first occurrence of `2`. 

- The first implementation would return index 1.
- The second implementation would return index 1.
- The third implementation would return index 2.
- The fourth implementation would return index 1, which is the correct answer.

Here is the code to test these implementations:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
x = 2

print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))  # expected output: 1
print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))  # expected output: 1
print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))  # expected output: 2
print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))  # expected output: 1
```

As you can see, the fourth implementation is the correct one.
