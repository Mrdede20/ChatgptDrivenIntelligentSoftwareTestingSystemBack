Yes, there exists an input which will make the two programs output different results. Consider the following list as the input:

`[3, 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 6, 7]`

When using the first implementation of quicksort, the output will be:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

When using the second implementation, the output will be:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
