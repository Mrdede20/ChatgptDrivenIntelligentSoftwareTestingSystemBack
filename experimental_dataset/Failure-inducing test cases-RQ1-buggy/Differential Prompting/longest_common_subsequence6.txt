Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Here's a test case:

```
a = 'ababa'
b = 'babab'

print(longest_common_subsequence_1(a, b))  # Output: 'abab'
print(longest_common_subsequence_2(a, b))  # Output: 'bbbb'
```

The first program `longest_common_subsequence_1` returns 'abab' as the longest common subsequence of 'ababa' and 'babab'. The second program `longest_common_subsequence_2` returns 'bbbb' as the longest common subsequence of the same input strings.
