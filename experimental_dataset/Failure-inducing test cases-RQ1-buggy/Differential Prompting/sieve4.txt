Yes, there is an input that can make the first four versions of the `sieve()` function output different results. 

Here is the test case in Python:

```
max = 10
print(sieve(max))
```

The first version of the `sieve()` function that uses `all()` and `>` in the condition will include the number 2 in the result, while the other three versions that use `any()` and `not` or `any()` alone will not include the number 2 in the result.

However, the fifth version of the `sieve()` function using `is_prime` list, will always include the number 2 as a prime number, even if `max` is 1.
