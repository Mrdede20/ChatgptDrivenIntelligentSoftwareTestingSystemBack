Yes, there is an input that could make the two programs have different output. 

Test case: [4.0, 5.0, '+', 2.0, 3.0, '-', '*']

Program 1 (original):
```
rpn_eval([4.0, 5.0, '+', 2.0, 3.0, '-', '*'])
# Output: 9.0
```

Program 2 (modified):
```
rpn_eval([4.0, 5.0, '+', 2.0, 3.0, '-', '*'])
# Output: -9.0
```

As you can see, the two programs return different results for the same input.
