Yes, there is an input that will make the two programs output a different result, and the input is a list of digits that already forms a palindrome, but is not the maximum possible palindrome. Here's an example input:

```
[1, 2, 2, 1]
```

The first implementation will return `[1, 3, 0, 1]`, which is the palindrome with the next highest value. The second implementation will return `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, which is the maximum possible palindrome.
