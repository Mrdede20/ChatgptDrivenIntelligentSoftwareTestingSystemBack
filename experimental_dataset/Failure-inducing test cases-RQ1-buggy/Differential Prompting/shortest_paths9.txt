Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Here is an example:

```
# Weighted directed graph
graph = {
    ('A', 'B'): 1,
    ('A', 'C'): 2,
    ('B', 'D'): -1,
    ('C', 'D'): 3
}

# Source node
source = 'A'

# Run the two versions of the function
result1 = shortest_paths(source, graph)
result2 = shortest_paths_v2(source, graph)

# Print the results
print(result1)  # {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 2}
print(result2)  # {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 4}
```

The two programs are supposed to calculate the shortest path weights from a given source node to all other nodes in a weighted directed graph. However, in the second program, there seems to be a typo in the calculation of the shortest path weights. Specifically, the weight of the edge (u, v) is added twice to the shortest path weight of v, instead of adding it only once. As a result, the second program produces incorrect output for some inputs.
