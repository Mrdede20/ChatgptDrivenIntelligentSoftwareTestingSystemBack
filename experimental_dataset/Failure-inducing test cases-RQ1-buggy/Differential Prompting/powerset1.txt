Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs output different results. Here's an example input:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

The first implementation and the third implementation will both return the correct result:

```
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

However, the second implementation will return a different result:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [1, 3], [3], [1, 2], [2], [1], []]
```

As we can see, the order of the subsets in the output is different.
