No, the two programs will have the same output for any given input as their functionality is exactly the same. The only difference is that in the first program, the `heapq` module is imported within the `kheapsort` function while in the second program, it is imported globally. However, this difference in importing does not affect the output of the function. 

Here's a test case you can use to verify that both functions output the same result:

```
arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 9, 7, 6]
k = 3

# Using function kheapsort version 1
print(list(kheapsort(arr, k)))

# Using function kheapsort version 2
print(list(kheapsort(arr, k)))
```

Both should output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
