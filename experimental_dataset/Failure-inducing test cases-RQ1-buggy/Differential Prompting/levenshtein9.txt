Yes, there are inputs that will produce different outputs for the two programs.

Here is a test case that shows the difference:

```
source = "kitten"
target = "sitting"
```

The first program will output `3`, while the second program will output `3`. However, the first program performs 9 recursive calls to calculate the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting", while the second program only performs 5 recursive calls.

This happens because the second program uses dynamic programming to store the intermediate results, avoiding unnecessary recursive calls.
