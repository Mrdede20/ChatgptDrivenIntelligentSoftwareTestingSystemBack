Yes, there are inputs that make the two programs have different outputs. Here's an example input:

```
text = "hello world\n"
cols = 5
```

If you pass this input to the two functions, you'll get different outputs. Here's what each function would return:

```
# First function
wrap("hello world\n", 5) -> ['hello', 'world\n']

# Second function
wrap("hello world\n", 5) -> ['hello', 'world']
```

As you can see, the first function includes the newline character in the last line, while the second function does not.
