Yes, there are input values that make the two programs have different output.

Here is a test case in Python:

```
n = 30
print(get_factors(n))
```

The output of the three functions for this test case would be:

```
[2, 3, 5]
[2, 3, 5]
[2, 3, 5]
``` 

As you can see, all three functions return the same output for this input.
