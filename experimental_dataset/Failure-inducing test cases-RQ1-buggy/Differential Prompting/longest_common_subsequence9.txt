Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs output different results. Here is the input that can demonstrate the difference:

```
a = 'aaaabaaa'
b = 'baaaaaba'
```

The first program may return either `'aaaa'` or `'aaaba'` as the longest common subsequence, while the second program always returns the optimal solution of `'aaaa'`.

This is because the second program uses memoization to store the results of previously computed subproblems, eliminating redundant function calls and improving the runtime complexity of the algorithm. In contrast, the first program uses a brute force approach that recomputes the same subproblems multiple times, resulting in a longer execution time and a potentially suboptimal solution.
