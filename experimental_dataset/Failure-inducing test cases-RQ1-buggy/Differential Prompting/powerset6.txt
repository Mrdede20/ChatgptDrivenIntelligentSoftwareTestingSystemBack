Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output.

For example, you can use the input `arr = [1, 2, 3]` to illustrate the difference in the output of the two programs.

Running the first program with this input will give the output:

`[[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]`

Running the second program with the same input will give the output:

`[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []]`

As you can see, the order of the subsets in the output is different in the two programs.
