Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different outputs. Consider a linked list that has multiple nodes, but the last node has a "successor" attribute that is set to None. In this case, the first implementation will terminate and return False, while the second implementation will cause an `AttributeError` exception when trying to access the `successor` attribute of `None`. Here's an example test case:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, successor=None):
        self.successor = successor

# create a linked list with a cycle
a = Node()
b = Node()
c = Node()
d = Node(None)
a.successor = b
b.successor = c
c.successor = b

# test the two implementations with the linked list
print(detect_cycle(a))  # output: True (both implementations return True)

# change the last node's successor to None
c.successor = None

# test the two implementations with the updated linked list
print(detect_cycle(a))  # output: False (first implementation returns False, second implementation raises an AttributeError)
```
