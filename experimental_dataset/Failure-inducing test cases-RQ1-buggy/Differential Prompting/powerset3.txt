Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different outputs. Here's an example:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

For this input, the first program will generate the following subsets:

```
[[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
```

while the second program will generate the following subsets:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [1, 3], [3], [1, 2], [2], [1], []]
```

The difference is in the order of the subsets, and in the first program, the subsets with the same size are grouped together.
