Yes, there is an input that can make the different programs output different results. The difference comes down to the use of the `is` operator versus the `==` operator when comparing `node` and `goalnode` in the `if` statement within the `while` loop. 

The `is` operator checks for object identity, while the `==` operator checks for object equality. Depending on the objects being compared and how they have been defined, these can be different things.

Here's an example input that can cause the programs to have different outputs:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.successors = []

    def add_successor(self, node):
        self.successors.append(node)

n1 = Node(1)
n2 = Node(2)
n3 = Node(3)
n4 = Node(4)

n1.add_successor(n2)
n2.add_successor(n3)
n3.add_successor(n4)

# This input sets `n4` as the start node, and `n1` as the goal node.
# With the `is` operator, the programs will return False.
assert not breadth_first_search(n4, n1)

# With the `==` operator, the programs will correctly return True.
assert breadth_first_search(n4, n1)
```

In this case, `n1` and `n4` are distinct objects, so `is` returns False when comparing them, but they have the same `value`, so `==` returns True.
