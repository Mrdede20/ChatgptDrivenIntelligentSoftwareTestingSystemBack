Here's a test case that produces different outputs for the two programs:

```
subsequences(1, 4, 2)
```

The first program will return:

```
[[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
```

while the second program will return:

```
[[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
```

Both programs will produce the same output for the given test case.
