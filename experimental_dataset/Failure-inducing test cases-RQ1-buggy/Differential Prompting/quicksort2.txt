Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different outputs. Here's the test case in Python:

```
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

print(quicksort(arr))
```

The output of the first implementation will be:

```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

While the output of the second implementation will be:

```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

Note that the two implementations will have the same output for this particular input. However, there may be other inputs that can produce different outputs for the two implementations.
