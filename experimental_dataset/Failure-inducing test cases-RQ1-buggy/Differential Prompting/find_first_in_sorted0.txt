No, there isn't any input that would make these programs return different output. They all perform the same task of finding the first occurrence of an element x in a sorted array arr using binary search. The only difference is in the implementation of the while loop condition, which is based on lo and hi variables. However, all three implementations have been carefully written to keep track of the boundaries correctly, and thus there is no input for which they would give different output.
