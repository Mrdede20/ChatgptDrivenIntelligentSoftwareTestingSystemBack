Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Here's the test case:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, successor=None):
        self.value = value
        self.successor = successor

# create a linked list with a cycle
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node1.successor = node2
node2.successor = node3
node3.successor = node2

print(detect_cycle(node1))  # True
```

In the first implementation, the condition check for `hare.successor` is done twice in the loop, which means that the loop may terminate earlier than the second implementation. This can cause the first implementation to return False for a cyclic linked list while the second implementation would correctly return True.
