Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs produce different output. The difference lies in the condition for the base case of the mergesort function:

In the first code example:

```
if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr
```

In the second code example:

```
if len(arr) == 0 or len(arr) == 1:
    return arr
```

And in the third code example:

```
if len(arr) == 1 or len(arr) == 0:
    return arr
```

In the fourth example, the condition is:

```
if len(arr) < 2:
    return arr
```

The difference is in the handling of the empty list. The first code example considers the empty list as a sorted list, while the other code examples return the empty list (as it is already sorted). Therefore, an input that includes an empty list would produce different output for the first code example compared to the other examples.

For example, calling `mergesort([3, 1, 4, [], 2, 0])` would produce a different output for the first code example compared to the other examples.
