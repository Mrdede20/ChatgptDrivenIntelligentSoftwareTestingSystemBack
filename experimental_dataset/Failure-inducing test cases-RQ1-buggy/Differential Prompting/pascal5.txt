Yes, there are test cases which will result in different output for the two programs. Here's an example with n = 3:

With the first program, pascal(3) returns:

[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]

With the second program, pascal(3) returns:

[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]

As you can see, the second program generates an additional row.
