Yes, there is an input that will produce different outputs for the three implementations. Here is an example input:

arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x = 2

The first implementation will return 1, which is the index of the first occurrence of the number 2 in the array.

The second implementation will also return 1 for the same input.

The third implementation will return 3, which is the index of the last occurrence of the number 2 in the array.

The fourth implementation will return 1, which is the index of the first occurrence of the number 2 in the array.

So, depending on the specific problem requirements, a different implementation might be needed.
