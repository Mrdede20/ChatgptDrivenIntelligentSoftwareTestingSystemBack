Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output.

Test Case:
```
hanoi(3, 1, 3)
```

The first implementation returns the following output:
```
[(1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3)]
```

The second implementation returns the following output:
```
[(1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3)]
```

As you can see, the second implementation has an extra move: `(3, 1)`.
