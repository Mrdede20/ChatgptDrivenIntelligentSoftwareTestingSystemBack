Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. The difference is in the 3rd line of the first program:
```
if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
```
It checks if the current element is less than the next element.

On the other hand, in the second program, the condition is:
```
if perm[i] >= perm[i+1]:
```
It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the next element.

Here's an input that makes the two programs produce different output:
```
perm = [1, 3, 2]
```
The first program produces `[2, 1, 3]` as the next permutation, while the second program produces `[2, 3, 1]`.
