No, both programs implement the same logic for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), using the Euclidean algorithm. The first program uses recursion while the second one uses a while loop, but they should produce the same output for any given inputs.

Here's a test case using Python to check that they produce the same output for a sample input:

```
a = 60
b = 48

# using first gcd function
print(gcd(a, b))

# using second gcd function
print(gcd(a, b))
```

Both functions should output 12 for these values of a and b.
