Yes, there is a possible input which can make the two programs above produce different output. One example could be a graph with a negative cycle. 

Here is an example input for testing:

```
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {
    ('A', 'B'): 1,
    ('B', 'C'): 1,
    ('C', 'D'): 1,
    ('D', 'B'): -4
}
```

In the first implementation of the `shortest_paths()` function, the algorithm will keep updating the shortest path weights infinitely since there is a negative cycle in the graph. This will result in the function never returning.

In the second implementation, the algorithm is a modification of the Bellman-Ford algorithm which can detect negative cycles and will return an empty dictionary when a negative cycle is detected. Therefore, the function will return `{}` for the above input.
