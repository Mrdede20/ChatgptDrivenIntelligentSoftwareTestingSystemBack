Yes, the two programs will have a different output for the input array that has duplicates. Here is the example of such input:

```
arr = [5, 3, 1, 1, 5, 8, 4, 0]
```

The first implementation will return:

```
[0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8]
```

While the second implementation will return:

```
[0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 5]
```

As you can see, the position of the duplicates is different in the sorted lists.
