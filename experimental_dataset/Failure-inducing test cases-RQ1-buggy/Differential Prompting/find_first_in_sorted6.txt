Yes, there is an input which makes the three programs have different output. 

An example input would be:
- arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
- x = 2

The first two programs might return 1 which is the index of the first occurrence of 2 in the array, while the last program will return 2, which is the correct index of the first occurence of 2 in the array. So, the third program is the correct algorithm for this binary search problem.

Here is the code to verify the outputs:

```
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
x = 2

print(find_first_in_sorted(arr, x))  # output will be 2
```
