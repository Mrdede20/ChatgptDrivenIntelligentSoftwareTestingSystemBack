Yes, there are some inputs that can make the two programs output different results.

For example, if you call `subsequences(1, 3, 2)`, the first program will return `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`, while the second program will return `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`.

However, if you call `subsequences(1, 3, 3)`, the first program will return `[[1, 2, 3]]`, while the second program will return `[]`.
