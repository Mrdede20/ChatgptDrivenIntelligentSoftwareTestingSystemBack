Yes, there is an input that could make the programs have different output. The difference in output is caused by the use of `is` versus `==` operators. The `is` operator checks whether two objects are the same object, while the `==` operator checks whether two objects are equal. 

Here's a test case: 

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.successors = []

    def add_successor(self, node):
        self.successors.append(node)

start = Node(1)
n2 = Node(2)
n3 = Node(3)
n4 = Node(4)
n5 = Node(5)

start.add_successor(n2)
start.add_successor(n3)
n2.add_successor(n4)
n3.add_successor(n4)
n4.add_successor(n5)

# Expected output: True
print(breadth_first_search(start, n5))
``` 

In this test case, the `start` node has two successors, `n2` and `n3`. In the while loop, `queue.extend(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen)` adds `n2` and `n3` to the queue, but the `node` variable only points to `n2`. The `node is goalnode` comparison in the if statement will return `False`, but `node == goalnode` will return `True`. Therefore, the fourth implementation will return `True` while the other implementations will return `False`.
