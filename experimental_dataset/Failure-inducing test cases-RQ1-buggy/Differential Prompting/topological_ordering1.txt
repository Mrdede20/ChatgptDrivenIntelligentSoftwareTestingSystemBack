Yes, there are inputs that could make the two programs output different results.

Here is an example input that could produce different outputs:

```
a = Node('A')
b = Node('B')
c = Node('C')
d = Node('D')

a.outgoing_nodes = [b, c]
b.incoming_nodes = [a]
b.outgoing_nodes = [d]
c.incoming_nodes = [a]
c.outgoing_nodes = [d]

nodes = [a, b, c, d]
```

In the first function, the output would be `[A, B, C, D]`, while in the second function, the output would be `[D, C, B, A]`. This is because the first function does a breadth-first search starting from nodes with no incoming edges and adds each node to the ordered list as it is visited, while the second function does a depth-first search starting from the first node and adds each node to the ordered list after all its outgoing edges have been visited.
