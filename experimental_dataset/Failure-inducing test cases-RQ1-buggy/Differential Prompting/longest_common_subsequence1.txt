Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here's a test case:

```
a = "abcba"
b = "bcaaa"
```

The first program will return "bca", which is the longest common subsequence of "abcba" and "bcaaa". The second program will return "bca", which is the same result. However, the two programs have different paths of execution and may have different performance characteristics for certain inputs.

The first program uses recursion and does not use memoization, while the second program uses memoization to avoid redundant recursive calls. For very large inputs, the second program may be much faster than the first.
