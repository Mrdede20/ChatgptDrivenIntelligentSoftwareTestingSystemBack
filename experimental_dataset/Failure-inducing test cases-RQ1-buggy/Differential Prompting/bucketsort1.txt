Yes, there is a potential input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is an example input that can cause a difference in output:

```
arr = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
k = 4
```

The first implementation will correctly sort the array:

```
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```

However, the second implementation will produce the incorrect result:

```
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
```

This is because in the second implementation, the `for` loop in the line `for i, count in enumerate(arr):` should use `enumerate(counts)` instead of `enumerate(arr)` in order to correctly access the count values of each index in the counts list.
