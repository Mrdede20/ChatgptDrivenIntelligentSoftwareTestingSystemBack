Yes, there exists an input that can make the two programs output different results. Here is an example:

```
perm = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
```
In the first program, the output will be `[1, 2, 4, 3]` because it finds the next permutation that's greater than the current sequence, and switches the position of 3 and 4. In the second program, the output will be `[1, 3, 2, 4]` because it searches for the smallest number larger than the i-th number on its right, in this case 4, and swaps 3 with 4.
