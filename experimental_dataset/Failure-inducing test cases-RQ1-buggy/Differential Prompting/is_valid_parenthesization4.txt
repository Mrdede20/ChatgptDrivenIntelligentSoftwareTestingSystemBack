Yes, the input "(())()" would make some of the programs return True while others return False. 

Here's how each implementation would handle this input:
- The first implementation would correctly return True.
- The second implementation would incorrectly return False.
- The third implementation would correctly return True.
- The fourth implementation would correctly return True.
- The fifth implementation would correctly return True.
- The sixth implementation would correctly return True.
- The seventh implementation would correctly return True.
- The eighth implementation would correctly return True.
- The ninth implementation would correctly return True.

The difference lies in the comparison used to check if the depth variable is equal to 0. Some implementations check for Truthy or Falsy values, while others use equality comparisons.
