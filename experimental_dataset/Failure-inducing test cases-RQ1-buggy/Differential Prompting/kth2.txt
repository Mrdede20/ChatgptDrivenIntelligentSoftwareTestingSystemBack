Yes, there is an input that could make the two programs output different results. 

Here's a test case that would cause the two programs to produce different results:

```
arr = [3, 7, 1, 5, 10, 2]
k = 3
```

In the first program `kth(arr, k)` would return `3`, while `kth_smallest_element(arr, k)` would return `2`.
