Yes, there are inputs that can make the different implementations of `reverse_linked_list` have different outputs. The difference between the three implementations is in the way the variables are assigned in the `while` loop. Specifically, the first implementation assigns to `prevnode` first, then updates `node.successor`, and then assigns to `node`. The second implementation assigns to both `prevnode` and `node` in a single line using tuple unpacking. The third implementation uses a single assignment statement to swap values of `node` and `prevnode`.

Here is an input that can make the three implementations have different outputs:
```
linked_list = Node(1, Node(2, Node(3)))
```
where `Node(n, successor=None)` is a simple linked list implementation that represents a node with value `n` and a `successor` pointer that points to the next node in the list.

With this input, the first implementation of `reverse_linked_list` returns a linked list with values `(3, 2, 1)` whereas the second and third implementations return linked lists with values `(1, 2, 3)`. The fourth implementation that you provided will also return a linked list with values `(3, 2, 1)` like the first one.
