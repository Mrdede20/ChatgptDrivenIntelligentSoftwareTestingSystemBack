Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs have different output. Here is one test case:

```
n = 8192
```

- `bitcount(n)` will return 1, because `8192` is a power of 2 and has only one set bit in its binary representation.
- `count_bits(n)` will return 2, because `8192` in binary is `0b10000000000000`, so there are 2 1's in the binary representation.

You can test it yourself in Python by running:

```
n = 8192
print(bitcount(n))   # Output: 1
print(count_bits(n)) # Output: 2
```
