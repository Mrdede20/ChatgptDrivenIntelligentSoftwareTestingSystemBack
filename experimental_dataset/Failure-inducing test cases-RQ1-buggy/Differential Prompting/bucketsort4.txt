Yes, there is a specific input that would cause these two implementations of `bucketsort` to have different output. Here's an example of such an input:

```python
arr = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
k = 3
```

With the first implementation of `bucketsort`, this input would result in:

```
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
```

With the second implementation of `bucketsort`, this input would result in:

```
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
```

To explain why the outputs are different, let's look at the two loops that construct the sorted array:

First implementation:

```
for i, count in enumerate(counts):
    sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)
```

This loop iterates over the counts list, and for each index `i`, it appends the value `i` to `sorted_arr` `count[i]` times. In other words, it's appending each key value `i` as many times as it appears in the original array `arr`.

Second implementation:

```
for i, count in enumerate(arr):
    sorted_arr.extend([i] * counts[i])
```

This loop iterates over the original array `arr`, and for each value `arr[i]`, it appends the value `i` to `sorted_arr` `counts[arr[i]]` times. In other words, it's appending each key value `i` as many times as it appears in `arr`, regardless of whether other key values appear more or less frequently.

In our example, the counts list would be `[3, 2, 3]`, since there are 3 zeros, 2 ones, and 3 twos in `arr`. When the second implementation iterates over `arr`, it first encounters `arr[0] == 2`, so it appends `0` to `sorted_arr` three times. Then it encounters `arr[1] == 2`, so it appends `1` to `sorted_arr` three times. Finally, it encounters `arr[2] == 2`, so it appends `2` to `sorted_arr` three times. This results in `sorted_arr` having length 9, with three extra zeros at the end compared to the first implementation.
