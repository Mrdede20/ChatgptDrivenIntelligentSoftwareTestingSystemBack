Yes, there is a test case that can make the two programs have different output.

Here's a test case:

```
# define the node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.successor = None

# define the nodes
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)

# create a cycle in the nodes
node1.successor = node2
node2.successor = node3
node3.successor = node4
node4.successor = node2

# test the two programs
print(detect_cycle(node1))  # expected output: True

def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True

print(detect_cycle(node1))  # expected output: False
```

The first version of the `detect_cycle` function returns `True` for the given test case because it checks whether `hare` and `tortoise` are the same node, without checking their values. In contrast, the second version of the function returns `False` for the same test case because it checks whether `hare` and `tortoise` have the same value and the same reference.
