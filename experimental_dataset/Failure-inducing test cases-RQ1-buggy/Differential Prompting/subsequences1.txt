Yes, there are test cases that will make the two programs have different output. Here's an example test case:

```
a = 1
b = 3
k = 2
```

For the first program, the output will be `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`, while for the second program, the output will be `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`.

In this specific case, the outputs are the same because they generate all possible sub-sequences of length 2 from the sequence [1,2,3], but for other cases, the outputs may differ because the two programs use different approaches to generate the sub-sequences.
