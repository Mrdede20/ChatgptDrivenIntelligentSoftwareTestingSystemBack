No, both programs implement the same algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. So, they should produce the same output for any input values.

Here's a test case in Python to verify that both implementations produce the same output:

```
a = 24
b = 36
print(gcd(a, b)) # expected output: 12
```
