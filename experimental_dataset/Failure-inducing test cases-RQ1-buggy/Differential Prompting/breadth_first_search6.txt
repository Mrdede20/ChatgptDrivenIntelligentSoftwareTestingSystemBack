Yes, there is an input which makes the first three programs have a different output from the last program. The difference is when comparing the node with the goalnode. The first three programs use the "is" operator to compare objects, while the last program uses the "==" operator, which compares values.

Here's a test case that demonstrates the difference:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.successors = []

node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node1.successors.append(node2)

assert breadth_first_search(node1, node2) == False
```

In the first three programs, the "is" operator is used to compare `node` with `goalnode` which checks if they are the same object in memory. Since `node2` is a different instance of the `Node` class than the `node2` stored in `node1.successors`, the `is` comparison will return False, and the function will return `False` as well.

In the last program, the `==` operator is used to compare `node` with `goalnode` which checks if the values of the two objects are equal. Since `node2` in `node1.successors` and `goalnode` are both instances of the `Node` class with the same `value`, the `==` comparison will return `True`, and the function will return `True` as well.

Therefore, the first three programs will return `False` for this test case, while the last program will return `True`.
