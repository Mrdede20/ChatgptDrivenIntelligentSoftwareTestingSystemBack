No, the two code snippets perform exactly the same function and provide the same output for any input. Both functions take an array and an integer k, and they sort the first k elements of the array in ascending order using a heap data structure. Then, the remaining elements of the array are inserted into the heap and sorted accordingly. Finally, the sorted elements are yielded one by one. 

The difference between the two code snippets is only in the first line of code. The first code snippet imports the `heapq` library within the function, whereas the second code snippet imports it globally. However, both approaches are valid and do not affect the output of the function.
