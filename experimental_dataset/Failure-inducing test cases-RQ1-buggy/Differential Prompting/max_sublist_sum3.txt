Yes, there are inputs that can produce different outputs for these four implementations of `max_sublist_sum`. Here's a test case to demonstrate:

```
arr = [0, -1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, 8]
```

For the first implementation, the output will be `10`.

For the second implementation, the output will be `8`.

For the third implementation, the output will be `8`.

For the fourth implementation, the output will be `8`.

The outputs differ because the second implementation resets the current sum to `0` whenever it becomes negative, while the other implementations use the current element as the new starting point for the sum when it is negative. In this particular test case, there are negative numbers that, when added to the previous sum, result in a smaller sum than just using the negative number itself, causing the first implementation to produce a higher sum.
