Yes, there is an input that could have different output for the two functions. 

Test case:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x = 3.5
```

For `find_in_sorted`, the output will be -1, because 3.5 is not in the array. This is because the binary search in `binsearch` is looking only at integer indices.

For `binsearch`, the output will be 2, because it returns the index of the closest match. In this case, the closest match is 3 at index 2, because `arr` is sorted and 3.5 is between 3 and 4.
