Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is a test case in Python:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
k = 3

print(kth(arr, k))               # Output: 4
print(kth_smallest_element(arr, k))   # Output: 3
```

In this case, the `kth` function returns the kth element that is greater than the pivot, while the `kth_smallest_element` function returns the kth smallest element, which is less than or equal to the pivot. The pivot in this input is 1, and the element at position 3 greater than 1 is 4, while the element at position 3 less than or equal to 1 is 3.
