Yes, there is an input that can make the programs above have different output. This is because of the difference in the condition check for the `while` loop. 

In the first two programs, the `while` loop continues as long as `queue` is non-empty, which means it will stop as soon as `queue` becomes empty. 

In the third program, the `while` loop continues as long as the length of `queue` is greater than `0`, which means it will stop only when `queue` becomes empty. 

In the fourth program, the `while` loop continues as long as the length of `queue` is not equal to `0`, which also means it will stop only when `queue` becomes empty. 

Here is a test case that can produce different outputs:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, successors):
        self.val = val
        self.successors = successors
  
# Create the graph
node3 = Node(3, [])
node2 = Node(2, [node3])
node1 = Node(1, [node2])

# Run the function with node1 and node3 as start and end points
print(breadth_first_search(node1, node3))
```

The above test case would produce the following outputs:

- The first two programs would return `True`.
- The third program would enter an infinite loop because `len(queue)` will always be greater than `0` even after all nodes have been processed.
- The fourth program would also enter an infinite loop because `len(queue)` will never be equal to `0` after the first iteration.
