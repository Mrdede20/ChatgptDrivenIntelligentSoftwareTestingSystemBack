Yes, there exist certain inputs that can make the outputs of the four implementations of max_sublist_sum function different. 

For example, consider the input array [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9]. 

The output of the first implementation will be 9, and that of the second and third implementations will be 10, whereas the output of the fourth implementation will be 14.

Therefore, it is important to carefully choose the implementation based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
