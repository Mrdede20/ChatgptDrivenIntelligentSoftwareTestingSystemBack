No, the two programs will produce exactly the same output for any given input. The only difference between the two programs is that the first one imports the `heapq` module inside the function, while the second one imports it at the module level. However, since both programs use the `heapq` module in exactly the same way, they will produce the same output regardless of where the module is imported.
