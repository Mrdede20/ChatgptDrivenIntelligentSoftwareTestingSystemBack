Yes, there can be input that makes the two programs have different output. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
a = "AGGTAB"
b = "GXTXAYB"
```
The first program will return "GTAB" as the longest common subsequence, while the second program will return "GAB". 

You can test this by running both programs with the above input and comparing the output.
