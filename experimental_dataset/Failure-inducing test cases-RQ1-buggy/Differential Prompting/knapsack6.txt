No, both programs are implementing the same algorithm and using the same logic. The only difference is the way they are implementing the memoization table. The first program uses a defaultdict while the second program uses a list of lists. However, the value for each cell in the table is being calculated in the same way. Hence, the output should be the same for any input.
