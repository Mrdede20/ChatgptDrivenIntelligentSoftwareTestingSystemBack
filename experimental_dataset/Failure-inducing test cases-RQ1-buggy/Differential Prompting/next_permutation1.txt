Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is the test case:

`perm = [1, 3, 2]`

The first program will return `[2, 1, 3]` while the second program will return `[2, 3, 1]`.

The reason for the difference is in the second for loop in the first program and the while loop in the second program. The second program will always choose the smallest element greater than `perm[i]` while the first program will choose the largest element greater than `perm[i]`. In the test case above, `perm[i] = 3` and the next largest element is 2 which will be chosen by the first program, while the next smallest element is 1 which will be chosen by the second program.
