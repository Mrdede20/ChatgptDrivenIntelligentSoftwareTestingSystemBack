Yes, there is an input that would make the two programs return different outputs. 

The difference between the two versions of the `mergesort` function is on how they handle arrays of length 0, 1 or 2. 

The first implementation considers arrays of length 0 or 1 as the base case, and arrays of length 2 are sorted without recursion. The second implementation and the third implementation handle arrays of length of 0 or 1 as the base case. The fourth implementation handles arrays of length less than 2 as the base case.

If the input is an array of length 2, the first implementation and the fourth implementation will sort it using recursion. The second implementation and third implementation will simply return the already sorted array. Therefore, for an input of length 2, the first implementation and fourth implementation will return a different output compared to the second implementation and third implementation.

Example: 

```
arr = [3, 1]
print(mergesort(arr)) # Output: [1, 3]
print(merge_sort(arr)) # Output: [1, 3]
```

In this example, both implementations return the same output for an array of length 2.
