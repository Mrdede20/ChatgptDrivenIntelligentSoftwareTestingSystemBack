Yes, there is an input that can make the four different implementations have different output. Here's the test case:

```
arr = [-1, 2, 3, -4, 5]
```

For the original implementation and the first alternative implementation, the output would be 6.
For the second alternative implementation, the output would be 5.
For the third alternative implementation, the output would be 7.
For the fourth alternative implementation, the output would be 7.

So the choice of which implementation to use depends on the specific behavior you want to achieve.
