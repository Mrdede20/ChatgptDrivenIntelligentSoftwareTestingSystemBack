Yes, there could be inputs that make the two programs output different results, because they use different approaches to solve the same problem (finding the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph). The first program uses a FibHeap, while the second program uses a regular heap. This difference in data structures and implementation details could lead to different results for certain inputs.

Here's a test case that could potentially produce different outputs for the two programs:

```
# Create a simple directed graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 2},
    'B': {'D': 5},
    'C': {'D': 1},
    'D': {}
}

# Find the shortest path from 'A' to 'D'
shortest_path_length(graph, 'A', 'D') # expected output: 3

dijkstras_shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'D') # expected output: 3
```

It's possible that both programs will output the same result for this test case, but it's also possible that they'll produce different results for other inputs.
