Yes, there might be an input which makes the two programs produce different output.

The difference is in how the `weight_by_edge` dictionary is iterated in the second for loop. In the first program, the `weight_by_edge` dictionary is iterated using the `.items()` method, which returns a list of key-value pairs. In the second program, the `weight_by_edge` dictionary is simply iterated, which returns only the keys of the dictionary.

If the order of the keys returned by iterating the dictionary is different from the order of the key-value pairs returned by the `.items()` method, then the two programs will produce different output.

Here's an example test case that produces different output for the two programs:

```
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {
    ('A', 'B'): 1,
    ('B', 'C'): 2,
    ('C', 'A'): -6
}

print(shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge)) # program 1
print(shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge)) # program 2
```

The expected output for program 1 is `{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': -5}`, while the expected output for program 2 is `{'A': 0, 'C': -5, 'B': -3}`.
