Yes, there is an input that would create different output for the three versions of mergesort. Here's the input:

arr = [2, 1, 3]

When passed to the first and third versions of mergesort, the resulting sorted array would be [1, 2, 3]. However, when passed to the second version of mergesort, the resulting sorted array would be [2, 1, 3].
