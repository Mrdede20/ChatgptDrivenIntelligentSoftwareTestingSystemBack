Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs have different output. Here's an example input:

```
n = 15
```

For this input, the first program will output `[3, 5]`, while the other two programs will output `[3, 5]` and `[3, 5]`, respectively. However, for some other inputs, such as primes or perfect squares, all three programs will produce the same output.
