Yes, there exists an input which makes the two programs output different results.

For example, if `start=1` and `end=2`, and the height of the tower is 3, the first program will output:

[(1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]

while the second program will output:

[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2)]

So the order in which the discs are moved is different between the two programs, even though they both solve the same problem.
