No, both of the provided functions behave the same way and return the same output for any input values a and b. 

Here's a test case in Python:

```
a = 36
b = 48

if gcd(a, b) == gcd(a, b):
    print("Both functions returned the same output")
else:
    print("The two functions returned different outputs")
```

The output of this program will always be "Both functions returned the same output".
