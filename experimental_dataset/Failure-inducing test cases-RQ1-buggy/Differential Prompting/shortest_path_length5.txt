Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs output different values. The first program uses a Fibonacci heap to maintain the unvisited nodes while the second program uses a regular heap. The performance of the two data structures is different and this can lead the two programs to return different values for large graphs. 

Here is a test case that can produce different outputs:

```
# Create a random graph
import random
graph = {}
for i in range(1000):
    graph[i] = {}
for i in range(10000):
    a, b, c = random.randint(0,999), random.randint(0,999), random.randint(1,100)
    graph[a][b] = c
    
# Test the two functions
start, end = 0, 999
length_by_edge = {}
for node in graph:
    for neighbor, cost in graph[node].items():
        length_by_edge[(node, neighbor)] = cost

assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, start, end) != dijkstras_shortest_path(graph, start, end)
``` 

Running this test case should return different values for the two programs.
