Yes, there exist inputs that would make the outputs of the four earlier versions different from the latest version. Here's a test case that would exhibit such behavior:

```python
sieve(25)
```

The latest version that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm would return `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]`. However, the earlier versions would return `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]` because they do not include `23`, which is a prime number less than or equal to `25`.
