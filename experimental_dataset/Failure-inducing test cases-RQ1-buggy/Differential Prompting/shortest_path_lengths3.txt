There's actually only one program in your question, it's just duplicated. Nonetheless, the output of the code depends only on the input parameters, so if you call both functions with the same input parameters, they will always return the same output.

However, if you change the input parameters, the output may change. Therefore, to answer your question, I need an actual input that you'd like me to use to compare the outputs of both functions.
