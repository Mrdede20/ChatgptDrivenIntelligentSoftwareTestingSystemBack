Yes, there are inputs that will make the two programs have different output.

Here's a test case that demonstrates the difference:

```
n = 6
```

The first program will return `[2, 3]` while the second program will return `[2, 3]`. However, the third program will return `[2, 3]` because it is factoring the input number into prime factors, whereas the first two programs are factoring the input number into factors.

In this specific test case, the difference is not noticeable, but for larger input numbers, the difference can be significant.
