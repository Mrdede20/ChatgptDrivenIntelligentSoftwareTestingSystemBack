Yes, the two programs can have different output if the input has a negative cycle in the graph. Here's an example:

```
graph = {
    (1, 2): 4,
    (1, 3): 2,
    (2, 3): 3,
    (2, 4): -1,
    (3, 5): 1,
    (4, 5): -2,
    (5, 2): -3   # negative cycle here (2->4->5->2)
}

# Using the first program
shortest_paths(1, graph) will output {1: 0, 2: -2, 3: 2, 4: -1, 5: -3} (detects the negative cycle and returns negative weights)

# Using the second program
shortest_paths(1, graph) will output {1: 0, 2: -2, 3: 2, 4: -3, 5: -1} (does not detect the negative cycle, yields incorrect weights)
