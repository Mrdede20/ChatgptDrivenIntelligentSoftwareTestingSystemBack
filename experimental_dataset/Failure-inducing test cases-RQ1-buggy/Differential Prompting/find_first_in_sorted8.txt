Yes, the two programs can have different output for the input where `x` is not present in the `arr` but can be inserted at the beginning of the array. Here's an example:

```
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5]
x = 1
```

The first program will return `-1` because `x` is not in the array and it will correctly determine this using binary search. 

The second program will also return `-1` because it uses binary search with `lo <= hi - 1` condition, which guarantees that the loop will terminate when the value of `lo` becomes greater than `hi`. 

The third program will also return `-1` because it uses binary search with `lo + 1 <= hi` condition, which also guarantees that the loop will terminate when the value of `lo` becomes greater than `hi`. 

However, the fourth program will return `0` because it explicitly checks for the case when `x` is not present in the array but can be inserted at the beginning. In this case, it will set `mid` to `0` and return it.
