Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs produce different output. 

For example:

arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]
k = 4

The first program will correctly sort the array and return [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], but the second program will return [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]. This is because in the second program, the `i` variable in the second for loop enumerates the values in `arr` rather than the indices. This causes the `sorted_arr` list to be populated with incorrect values.
