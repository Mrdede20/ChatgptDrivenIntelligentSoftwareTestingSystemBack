Yes, there is an input which can make the two programs have different output. 

For example, consider the following test case:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x = 4.5

In the first program, find_in_sorted(arr, x) would return -1 because 4.5 is not in the array and the code returns -1 if the element is not found.

In the second program, find_in_sorted(arr, x) would return 3 because 4 is the closest element to 4.5 in the array and the code returns the index of the closest element if the element is not found.
