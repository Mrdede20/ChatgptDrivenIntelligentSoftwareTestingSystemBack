Yes, there could be a difference in the output for certain inputs because the order of assignment statements affects which value is assigned to which variable. 

Here is an example input that would produce different output for the three functions:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, successor=None):
        self.val = val
        self.successor = successor

n1 = Node(1)
n2 = Node(2)
n3 = Node(3)

n1.successor = n2
n2.successor = n3

print(reverse_linked_list(n1).val)
```

The expected output for the first two versions of `reverse_linked_list` is `3` because `n1.successor` is reversed to point to `None`, while `n2.successor` points to `n1`. However, the expected output for the third version is `1` because `prev` and `curr` are assigned before `curr.successor` is reassigned, resulting in a different order of operations.
