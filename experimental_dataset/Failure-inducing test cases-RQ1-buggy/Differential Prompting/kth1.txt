Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Consider the input array `[1, 1, 2]` and k = `2`. 

The first program `kth([1, 1, 2], 2)` would return `2` (the first element greater than the pivot), while the second program `kth_smallest_element([1, 1, 2], 2)` would return `1` (the kth smallest element, which is the second `1` in the array).
