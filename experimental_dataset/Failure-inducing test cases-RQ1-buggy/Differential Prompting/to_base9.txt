Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here is a test case in Python:

```
num = 25
b = 2
print(to_base(num, b))  # Output: "11001" (for the first and third versions)

num = 25
b = 2
print(to_base(num, b))  # Output: "10011" (for the second version)
```

In the while loop of the second version, `result` is constructed in reverse order and then the final string is reversed using `result[::-1]`. However, in the for loop of the third version, `result` is constructed in the correct order. As a result, the second version and the other two versions will produce different outputs for the same input.
