Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs output different results. This can happen if the two implementations return different longest common subsequence strings.

Here's an example input:

```
s = "ABCDABD"
t = "ADCAABD"
```

The first implementation will return a value of 4, while the second implementation will return a value of 3. This is because the longest common subsequence for this input is "ABD", which has a length of 3, and the two implementations use different dynamic programming approaches to compute the length of the LCS.
