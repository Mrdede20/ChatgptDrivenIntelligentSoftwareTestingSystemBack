Yes, there are inputs that can make these two programs produce different outputs. This can happen when all the elements in the input array are distinct but negative.

For example, consider the input array `[-3, -2, -1, -4, -5]`. The first program will output 3, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence (`[-3, -2, -1]`). However, the second program will output 2, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence (`[-3, -1]` or `[-2, -1]`). 

To see why this happens, note that in the first program, the condition `val < arr[ends[length + 1]]` is only checked if `length == longest`, whereas in the second program, the `longest` variable is updated after the condition is checked. So in the first program, the element `-4` is added to the longest increasing subsequence (of length 3), whereas in the second program, it is not.

You can test this with the following code:

```
print(lis([-3, -2, -1, -4, -5]))  # Output: 3
```
