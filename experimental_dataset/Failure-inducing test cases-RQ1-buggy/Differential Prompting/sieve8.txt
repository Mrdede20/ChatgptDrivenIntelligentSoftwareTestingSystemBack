Yes, there is an input which can make the programs have different output.

Here is a test case:
```
sieve(2)
```
The first two implementations will return `[2]`, while the other implementations will return `[]`. The reason is that the first two implementations consider 2 to be a prime number, while the other implementations do not. The last implementation correctly handles this case by using a list to track whether a number is prime rather than relying solely on the list of primes.
