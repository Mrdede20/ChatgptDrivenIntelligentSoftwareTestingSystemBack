Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs output different results. Here is a test case:

```
tokens = [2, 2, 2, '+', '*', 3, 3, '-', '/']
print(rpn_eval(tokens))
```

The expected output is `2`, but the second program's output will be `0.5`. The reason for this difference is due to a small variation in the `op()` function of the second program. In the lambda function for division '/', the operands `a` and `b` are reversed when passed to the division operator, resulting in a different computation order.
