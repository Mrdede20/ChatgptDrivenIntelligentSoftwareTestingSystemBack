Yes, there can be inputs that make the programs have different output. Here is a test case in Python that demonstrates the difference:

```python
arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]

max_sublist_sum_1(arr)  # returns 7
max_sublist_sum_2(arr)  # returns 7
max_sublist_sum_3(arr)  # returns 7
max_sublist_sum_4(arr)  # returns 7
max_sublist_sum(arr)    # returns 7
```

In this test case, all of the implementations return the same result, which is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array. However, there can be other inputs that make the programs have different output. Therefore, it is important to test the programs thoroughly and compare the results to make sure that they are correct.
