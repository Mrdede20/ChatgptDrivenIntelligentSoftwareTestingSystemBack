Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs output different results. Here is an example:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

The first implementation outputs:

```
[[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
```

The second and third implementations output:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []]
```

As you can see, the order of the subsets is different between the two implementations.
