Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different outputs. 

For example, if x = 10 and epsilon = 0.1, the first program will return 3.196, while the second program will return 3.162.

Here is the code to illustrate this: 

```
# Test case
x = 10
epsilon = 0.1

# First program
result1 = sqrt(x, epsilon)
print("Result 1:", result1)

# Second program
result2 = sqrt(x, epsilon)
print("Result 2:", result2)
```
