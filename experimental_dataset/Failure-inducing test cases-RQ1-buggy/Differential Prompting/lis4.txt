Yes, there exist inputs that can make the two programs above have different output. The difference is due to the last line of the second program: `longest = max(length + 1, longest)`.

If the input array is `[3, 2, 5, 1, 6]`, the first program returns 3 while the second program returns 4. 

You can test this by running the following code:

```
    arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 6]

print("Using first program:", lis(arr))  # Output: 3
print("Using second program:", lis(arr))  # Output: 4
```
