No, the two programs provide the same output for all inputs. Both programs implement the dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The first implementation uses a default dictionary to store the memoization table, while the second implementation uses a 2D list. The logic and order of operations are the same in both implementations, hence they would return the same output for any input.
