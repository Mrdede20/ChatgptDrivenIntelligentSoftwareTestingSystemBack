No, both programs are using binary search algorithm to find the index of the target element `x` in the sorted array `arr`. The only difference is that the first program is using nested functions and the second program is using a separate function for binary search with additional arguments. 

As for the test case, you can try the following:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x = 7

print(find_in_sorted(arr, x)) # should print -1 for both functions
``` 
This will test the scenario where the target element is not present in the sorted array.
