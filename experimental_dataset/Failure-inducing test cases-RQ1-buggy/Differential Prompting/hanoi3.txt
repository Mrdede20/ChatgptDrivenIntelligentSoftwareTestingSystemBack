Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs have different outputs. Here's a test case:

```
hanoi(3, 1, 3)
```

The first program will return:

```
[(1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3)]
```

While the second program will return:

```
[(1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 3)]
```

The output is the same.
