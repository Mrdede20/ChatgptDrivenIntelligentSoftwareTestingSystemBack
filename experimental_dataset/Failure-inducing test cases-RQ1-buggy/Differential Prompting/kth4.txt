Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. Here's a test case:

```
arr = [4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]
k = 5
print(kth(arr, k))              # Output: 5
print(kth_smallest_element(arr, k))  # Output: 6
```

In this test case, both functions are supposed to return the `k`th smallest element of the array `arr`, which is 5. However, the two functions handle duplicates differently, which leads to different outputs. 

`kth()` counts duplicates as elements smaller than the pivot, so it considers only the first two 4's and the first two 5's as less than the pivot. Therefore, it searches for the 5th smallest element in the subarray `[4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`, which is 5.

`kth_smallest_element()` considers all duplicates as elements less than or equal to the pivot. Therefore, it searches for the 5th smallest element in the subarray `[4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`, which is 6.
