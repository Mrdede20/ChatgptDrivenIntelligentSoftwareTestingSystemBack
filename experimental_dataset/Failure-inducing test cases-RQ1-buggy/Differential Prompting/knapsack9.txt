No, the two programs will always produce the same output for any given input. The first implementation is using a defaultdict to instantiate the memo table whereas the second implementation uses a regular 2D list. Other than this difference, the two implementations compute the knapsack problem in the same way. Both implementations will visit every entry in the memo table exactly once, so the time complexity is O(nc) (where n is the number of items and c is the capacity of the knapsack) for both implementations. Additionally, the space complexity is also O(nc) for both implementations.
