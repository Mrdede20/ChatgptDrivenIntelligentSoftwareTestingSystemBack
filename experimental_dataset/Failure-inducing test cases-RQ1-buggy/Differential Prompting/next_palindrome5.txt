Yes, there are test cases that will make the two programs output different results. Here's an example test case:

digit_list = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

The first program will return [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], while the second program will return [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. 

This is because the first program assumes that the input digit_list is not already a palindrome and directly returns the next highest palindrome. However, the second program first checks if the input digit_list is already a palindrome and only returns the next highest palindrome if it is not. In this case, the input digit_list is already the maximum palindrome and the second program returns [1] + (len(digit_list) - 1) * [0] + [1] instead of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
