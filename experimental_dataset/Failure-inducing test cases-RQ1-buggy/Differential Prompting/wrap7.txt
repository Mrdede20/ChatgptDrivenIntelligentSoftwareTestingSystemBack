Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. 

Test case: 

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
cols = 11
```

The first implementation will produce the following output:

```
['The quick', 'brown fox', 'jumps over', 'the lazy', 'dog']
```
while the second implementation will produce the following output:

```
['The quick', 'brown fox', 'jumps over', 'the lazy dog']
```

As you can see, the first implementation splits the last word "dog" into a separate line, while the second implementation includes it in the previous line.
