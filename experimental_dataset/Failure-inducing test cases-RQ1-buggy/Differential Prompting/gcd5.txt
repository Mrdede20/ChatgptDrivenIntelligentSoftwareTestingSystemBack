No, both implementations should return the same output for any input `(a, b)`. You can test this by running the following code snippet in Python:

```
# Test case
a = 123456
b = 7890

# First implementation
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)

print(gcd(a, b)) # Output: 6

# Second implementation
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

print(gcd(a, b)) # Output: 6
```

As you can see, both implementations return the same result for the input `(123456, 7890)`.
