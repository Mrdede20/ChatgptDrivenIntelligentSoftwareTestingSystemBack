Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs output different results.

For example, let's say we call the function with the arguments `(2, 4, 2)`. The expected output should be `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]`. 

However, if we call the first implementation with these arguments, it will return `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]` as expected. But if we call the second implementation with these arguments, it will return `[[2, 3], [2, 4]]`, which is missing the `[3, 4]` subsequence. This happens because in the second implementation, the check for `k==1` causes it to stop generating subsequences after k has been reduced to 1. While in the first implementation, the code keeps running until it has generated all possible subsequences for k. 

Here is the test case in Python: 

```python
def test_subsequences():
    assert subsequences(2, 4, 2) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
```

You can call the `test_subsequences` function to confirm that the second implementation fails the test, while the first implementation passes it.
