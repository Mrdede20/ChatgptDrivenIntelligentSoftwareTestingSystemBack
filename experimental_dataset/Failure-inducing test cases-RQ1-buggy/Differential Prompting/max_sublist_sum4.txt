Yes, there can be inputs that make the programs have different output.

For example, if the input array is [1, -2, 3], the first implementation and the fourth implementation will return 3, which is the maximum subarray sum. However, the second and third implementations will return 1, which is the sum of the single element subarray [1]. 

Here's the output for each implementation:

First implementation: max_sublist_sum([1, -2, 3]) -> 3
Second implementation: max_sublist_sum([1, -2, 3]) -> 1
Third implementation: max_sublist_sum([1, -2, 3]) -> 1
Fourth implementation: max_sublist_sum([1, -2, 3]) -> 3
