No, there is no input which makes the two programs above have different outputs as both algorithms compute the length of the longest common subsequence between two given strings s and t. 

Here is a test case you can use to verify the correctness of the algorithms:
```
s = "abcde"
t = "ace"
print(lcs_length(s, t)) # expected output: 3
```
