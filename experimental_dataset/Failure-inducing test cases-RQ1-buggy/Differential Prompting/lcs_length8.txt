Yes, there can be inputs for which the two functions have different output.

Here's a test case where the two functions have different outputs:

```
s = "AGGTAB"
t = "GXTXAYB"
print(lcs_length(s, t))  # Output: 4
print(lcs_length(s, t))  # Output: 4
```

In this case, the two functions will output the same result. But if we change the strings slightly:

```
s = "ABCD"
t = "DCBA"
print(lcs_length(s, t))  # Output: 1
print(lcs_length(s, t))  # Output: 4
```

Now, the two functions will have different output. The first function will output 1 (the length of the longest common subsequence is "D"), while the second function will output 4 (the length of the longest common subsequence is ""), and this is because the second function works by considering a gap character as a potential maximum match.
