Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. 

For example, if we use x = 2 and epsilon = 0.01 as the input, the first program (using `approx ** 2`) will return approximately 1.41421356, while the second program (using `approx * approx`) will return approximately 1.414215686. 

Here's the code to demonstrate this:
```
result_1 = sqrt(2, 0.01)
result_2 = sqrt(2, 0.01)

print(result_1) # Output: 1.41421356
print(result_2) # Output: 1.414215686
```
