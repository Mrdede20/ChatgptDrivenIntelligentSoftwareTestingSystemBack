Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different outputs. The condition in the first program (`x < pivot`) ensures that all elements in the lesser list are strictly less than the pivot, and all elements in the greater list are greater than or equal to the pivot. 

In the second program, the condition in the lesser list is `x <= pivot`, which means elements equal to the pivot, in addition to elements less than the pivot, will be placed in the lesser list. Similarly, greater items will be placed in the greater list using the condition `x > pivot`.

Therefore, for an input array with repeated elements, the two programs may produce different output since the first program puts all equal elements in the pivot section, while the second program spreads the equal elements between the lesser and greater lists.
