Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs output different results. 

Here is a test case:

```
x = 10
epsilon = 0.0001
```

The first program will return approximately `3.16228`, while the second program will return approximately `3.162277660168379`. 

The difference in output is due to the use of `**` and `*` operators in the two programs. The `**` operator performs exponentiation, while the `*` operator performs multiplication. In the first program, `approx ** 2` calculates `approx` to the power of 2, while in the second program, `approx * approx` performs multiplication of `approx` by itself. 

Since exponentiation and multiplication can produce different results for certain inputs, the two programs can produce different outputs.
