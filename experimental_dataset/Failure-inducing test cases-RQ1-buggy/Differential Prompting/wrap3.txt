Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs output differently. Here's a test case that demonstrates the difference:

```
text = "hello world\nthis is a test"
cols = 8
```

For the first implementation, the output will be:

```
['hello', 'world\nthis', 'is a', 'test']
```

For the second implementation, the output will be:

```
['hello', 'world\nthis', 'is a', 'test']
```

So both programs have the same output for this input. However, if we change the input slightly to:

```
text = "hello world\nthis is a test"
cols = 7
```

The first implementation will produce:

```
['hello', 'world\n', 'this is', 'a test']
```

While the second implementation will produce:

```
['hello', 'world', '\nthis', 'is a', 'test']
```

So for this input, the two programs have different output.
