Yes, there is an input that will make the two programs output different results. The difference is in the condition inside the while loop. In the first program, the condition is `abs(x - approx ** 2) > epsilon`, while in the second program it is `abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon`. These conditions are equivalent, except when `x` is negative. For example, if `x = -4` and `epsilon = 0.01`, the first program will return a complex number `2j`, while the second program will return the real number `nan` (not a number), because the intermediate result `approx * approx` will be negative and the `abs` function cannot operate on negative numbers.
