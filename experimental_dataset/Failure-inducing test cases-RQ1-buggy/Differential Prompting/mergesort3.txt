Yes, the two programs have different outputs for the input `arr = []`. 

- The first program will return `[]` without any errors.
- The second program will return `None` because the base case `if len(arr) <= 1:` is checking for array length less than or equal to 1, while the input array has length 0. 

To fix the issue in the second program, you can modify the base case to check for length less than 2, like this:

```
if len(arr) < 2:
    return arr
``` 

This will cover both empty arrays and arrays with just one element, making the second program equivalent to the first program in behavior.
