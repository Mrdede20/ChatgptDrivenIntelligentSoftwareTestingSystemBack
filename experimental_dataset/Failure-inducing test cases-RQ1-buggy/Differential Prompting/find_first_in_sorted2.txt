Yes, there is an input which makes the three programs have different output. For example, consider the sorted array `arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]` and the value to search `x = 2`. 

- The first program will return index 1 because it stops the loop as soon as it finds the first occurrence of `x`.
- The second program will return index 1 because it starts the loop with `hi` set to `len(arr)` instead of `len(arr) - 1`.
- The third program will return index 3 because it uses `lo <= hi` instead of `lo < hi`. It is able to continue the loop even when `lo == hi` (i.e., `mid` is the only element left to check) and therefore finds the first occurrence of `x` that the second program missed.

The fourth program (the one I provided) should always return the correct index for any input because it uses a standard binary search algorithm that properly handles all cases.
