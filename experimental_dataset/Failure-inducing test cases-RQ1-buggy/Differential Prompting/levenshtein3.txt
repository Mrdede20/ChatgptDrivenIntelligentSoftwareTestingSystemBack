Yes, there can be cases where the two programs will have different outputs for the same input. 

For example, if the source string is "kitten" and the target string is "sitting", the first program will return 3 while the second program will return 2. 

You can test this using the following code:

```
print(levenshtein("kitten", "sitting"))  # Outputs 3 for the first function
print(levenshtein("kitten", "sitting"))  # Outputs 2 for the second function
```
