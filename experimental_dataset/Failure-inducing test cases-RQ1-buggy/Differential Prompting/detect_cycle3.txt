Yes, there is an input that could cause the two `detect_cycle()` functions to have different output. 

Here is an example input to demonstrate the difference:

```
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# List with a loop of length 1
n0 = ListNode(0)
n1 = ListNode(1, n0)
n0.next = n0
```

When you call `detect_cycle(n1)` with this input, the first `detect_cycle()` function will return `True`, while the second one will return `False`. This is because the second function's loop detection condition is stricter and will not detect a loop of length 1.
