Yes, there are inputs that can make the two implementations output different results. One such input would be setting the `height` parameter to 0, which would cause the recursive solution to return an empty list of steps (`[]`), while the iterative solution would return an empty list (`steps = []`) with no steps appended to it. 

Here's an example test case in Python:

```
# Test case
height = 0
start = 1
end = 3

# Recursive solution
print(hanoi(height, start, end))  # []

# Iterative solution
print(hanoi(height, start, end))  # []
```

Output:
```
[]
[]
```
