Yes, there are inputs that could make the two programs have different output. Here's an example test case in Python:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.incoming_nodes = []
        self.outgoing_nodes = []

node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)

node3.incoming_nodes = [node1]
node1.outgoing_nodes = [node3]
node1.incoming_nodes = [node2]
node2.outgoing_nodes = [node1]

# expected output of first program: [node2, node1, node3]
# expected output of second program: [node3, node1, node2]

print(topological_ordering([node1, node2, node3]))
``` 

In this example, both programs implement a topological sorting algorithm that should return a list of nodes in topological order. However, the order in which the nodes are added to the ordered_nodes list could differ between the two implementations, leading to different output.
