Yes, there are inputs which make the provided implementation and the four alternative implementations have different output. Here is a test case:
```
max_sublist_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]) # Expected output: 7
```
The provided implementation and the implementation with `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)` correctly return 7, which is the maximum subarray sum. However, the implementations with `max_ending_here = max(max_ending_here + x, 0)` and `max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)` both incorrectly return 5. Meanwhile, the implementation with `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x, 0)` incorrectly returns 4.
