Yes, there is an input which can make the two programs output different results. Here's a test case in Python:
```
arr = [7, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 8]

# Output of first program should be 5
print(lis(arr))

# Output of second program should be 6
print(lis(arr))
```
The first program implements the Patience sorting algorithm while the second program implements the standard dynamic programming approach for solving the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. The key difference between the two programs is that the Patience sorting algorithm always returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence, while the dynamic programming approach may return the length of a non-increasing subsequence if the input sequence has repeated elements. 

In the given test case, the longest increasing subsequence is [1, 3, 5, 6, 8], which has length 5. However, since the input sequence contains repeated elements (i.e., the numbers 2 and 4), the dynamic programming approach may count them as part of the longest increasing subsequence and return a longer length of 6.
