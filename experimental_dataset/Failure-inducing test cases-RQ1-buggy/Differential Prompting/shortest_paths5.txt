Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output.

Here is a test case that will cause the programs to have different outputs:

```
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {
    ('A', 'B'): 1,
    ('B', 'C'): 1,
    ('C', 'A'): -3
}
```

The first program will return the following dictionary:

```
{'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': -2}
```

while the second program will result in an infinite loop, since the negative cycle causes the minimum distance to never be reached
