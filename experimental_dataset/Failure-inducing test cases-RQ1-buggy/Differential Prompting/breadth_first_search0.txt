No, there is no input that will make these programs have different output as they all have the same logic and implement Breadth-First Search algorithm similarly. The differences in the conditions of the while loop are irrelevant as they are all equivalent. The difference between "while queue", "while len(queue)" and "while len(queue) > 0" is only a matter of style and readability of the code. However, the condition "if node == goalnode" in the last program is more readable than "if node is goalnode" as it is more clear and explicit.
