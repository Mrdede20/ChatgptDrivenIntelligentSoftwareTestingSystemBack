No, there is no input that can make these programs produce different outputs since they use the same approach to solve the problem of counting the number of possible ways to make a given total using a given set of coins, which is a recursive backtracking algorithm. The only difference among these implementations is how they check the base cases that stop the recursion, which should not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
