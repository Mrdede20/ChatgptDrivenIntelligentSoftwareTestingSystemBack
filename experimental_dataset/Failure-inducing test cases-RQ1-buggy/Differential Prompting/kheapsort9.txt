No, the two programs have the same output for all inputs. The only difference between them is the import statement for the `heapq` module, but it does not affect the output of the programs. You can use the following test case to confirm this:

```
arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7]
k = 3

output1 = list(kheapsort(arr, k))
output2 = list(kheapsort(arr, k))

assert output1 == output2
```
