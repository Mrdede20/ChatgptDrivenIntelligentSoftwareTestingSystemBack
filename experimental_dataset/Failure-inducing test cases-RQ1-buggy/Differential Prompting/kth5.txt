Yes, there exists an input that can make the two programs output different results. One such input is:

arr = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
k = 3

In the function `kth()`, the first element of the array is used as the pivot. For this input, the pivot will be 2. The `below` list will be [2, 2], and the `above` list will be [3, 4, 5, 6]. Then, `num_less` will be 2, and `num_lessoreq` will be 4. Since k < num_less, the function will recursively call `kth()` with the `below` list and k=3. The new pivot will be 2, and the `below` list will be empty. The `above` list will be [3, 4, 5, 6]. Since k is not less than the length of `above`, the function will recursively call `kth()` with the `above` list and k'=1 (k - num_lessoreq).

In the `kth_smallest_element()` function, the implementation is different from the `kth()` function. Specifically, the code checks for equality to the pivot in the `below` and `above` lists. Therefore, the `below` list will be [2, 2], and the `above` list will be [3, 4, 5, 6]. Then, `num_less` will be 2, and `num_lessoreq` will be 4. Since k < num_less, the function will recursively call `kth_smallest_element()` with the `below` list and k=3. The new pivot will be 2 again, and the `below` list will be empty. The `above` list will be [3, 4, 5, 6]. Since k is not less than the length of `above`, the function will recursively call `kth_smallest_element()` with the `above` list and k'=1 (k - num_lessoreq).

Finally, the `kth()` function will recursively call `kth()` with `above` list and k' = 1. The pivot will be 4, and the `below` list and `above` list will be empty. So, `kth()` will return 4. Whereas the `kth_smallest_element()` function will recursively call `kth_smallest_element()` with `above` list and k'=1. The pivot will be 4, and the `below` list will be [3]. and the `above` list will be [5, 6]. Since k' is not less than the length of `above` list, the function will recursively call `kth_smallest_element()` with the `below` list and k''=0. Then, the function will return 3.

Therefore, the two functions will have different outputs for the given input.
