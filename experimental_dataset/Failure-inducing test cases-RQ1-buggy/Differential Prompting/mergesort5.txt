Yes, there is an input that would make the two programs have different output.

The difference between the programs lies in the conditions for the base case in the recursive function calls.

In the first program, the base case is `if len(arr) <= 1:` which means that any input list with length of 1 or less will not undergo any sorting.

In the second program, the base case is `if len(arr) == 0 or len(arr) == 1:` which means that any input list with length of 0 or 1 will not undergo any sorting.

In the third program, the base case is `if len(arr) == 1 or len(arr) == 0:` which is same as the second program and will result to the same output.

Finally, the fourth program has its base case as `if len(arr) < 2`, which is equivalent to the first base case.

Here's a test case to demonstrate the difference:

```
arr = []  # empty list

# first program
print(mergesort(arr))  # []

# second program
print(mergesort(arr))  # []

# third program
print(mergesort(arr))  # []

# fourth program
print(merge_sort(arr))  # []
```

In this test case, all the programs will return an empty list because it is already sorted. However, if we add an element to the list:

```
arr = [1]

# first program
print(mergesort(arr))  # [1]

# second program
print(mergesort(arr))  # [1]

# third program
print(mergesort(arr))  # [1]

# fourth program
print(merge_sort(arr))  # [1]
```
In the above case, the first three programs will return the input list because it has a length of 1 and does not satisfy the base condition for sorting. However, the fourth program will sort the list even though it has length 1 because its base case is equivalent to the first program.
