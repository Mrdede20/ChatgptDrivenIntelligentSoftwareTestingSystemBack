One test case that could trigger a bug is when length_by_edge contains a negative weight cycle. In this case, the function shortest_path_lengths should raise an exception, as there is no well-defined shortest path between some pairs of vertices.

Here's an example of such a test case:

n = 4
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (1, 2): 2,
    (2, 3): 3,
    (3, 1): -6
}

try:
    shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge)
except ValueError:
    # the function should raise a ValueError exception
    pass
else:
    assert False, "test failed: expected ValueError exception"

In this test case, the edge (3, 1) has a negative weight, which creates a negative weight cycle in the graph. The function should detect this and raise a ValueError exception. The test case checks whether the function indeed raises the exception.
