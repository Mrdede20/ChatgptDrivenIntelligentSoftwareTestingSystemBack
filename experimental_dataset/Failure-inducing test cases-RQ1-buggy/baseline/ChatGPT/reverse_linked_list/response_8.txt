Test case:

# create a linked list with 3 nodes
node3 = Node(3)
node2 = Node(2, node3)
node1 = Node(1, node2)

# reverse the linked list
reversed_list = reverse_linked_list(node1)

# check if the reversed list is correct
assert reversed_list == node3

This test case triggers a bug in the reverse_linked_list() function. The bug is that the function is not setting the prevnode variable to the last node in the original linked list. Therefore, when the function returns prevnode, it returns None instead of the last node.

The test will fail because the assert statement will check if reversed_list is equal to node3, which is the last node in the original linked list. However, since reverse_linked_list() returns None, the test will fail because None is not equal to node3.
