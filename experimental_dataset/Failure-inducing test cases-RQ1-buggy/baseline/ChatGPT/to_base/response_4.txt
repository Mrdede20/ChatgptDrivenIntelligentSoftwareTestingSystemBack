Test Case:

num = 10
b = 0

Expected Output:

Error: Division By Zero

Actual Output:

Error: Division By Zero

Result:

The program does not handle the scenario where the value of b is passed as 0, which results in a division by zero error. This bug causes the program to fail and terminate prematurely. Therefore, the test case has triggered the bug and resulted in test failure.
