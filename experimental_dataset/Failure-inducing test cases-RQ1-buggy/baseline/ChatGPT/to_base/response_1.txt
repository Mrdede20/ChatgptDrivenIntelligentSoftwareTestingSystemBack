Test Case: 
1. Input: num = 10, b = 0
    Expected Output: ValueError
    Reason: The value of 'b' for base cannot be 0. This should raise a ValueError.
2. Input: num = -10, b = 2 
    Expected Output: TypeError
    Reason: The function does not handle negative numbers, and since the function uses integer division, attempting to divide negative numbers will result in a TypeError.
3. Input: num = 123, b = 6
    Expected Output: '231'
    Reason: This is a valid test case and should pass. 
4. Input: num = 15, b = 16
    Expected Output: 'F' 
    Reason: This is a valid test case and should pass.
5. Input: num = 'Fifteen', b = 10
    Expected Output: TypeError
    Reason: The function expects an integer for 'num', and passing a string will cause a TypeError.
