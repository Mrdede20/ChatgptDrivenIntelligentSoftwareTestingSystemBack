Test Case:
Input: to_base(10, 0)
Expected Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'int' and 'int'

Explanation:
The program takes two arguments - num and b, where num is the decimal number to be converted to base b. In the test case above, we have given 0 as the base, which is not a valid input since the base should be greater than 0. When the program tries to execute the line num = num // b, it will result in a TypeError since we are trying to perform a division operation between an integer and another integer value 0. Thus, the program will fail to execute correctly and result in a test failure.
