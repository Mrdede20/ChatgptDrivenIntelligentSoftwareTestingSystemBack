Test case: 

Input: 
- num = 17 
- b = 0

Expected Output:
- Error message: "Invalid input: base (b) cannot be zero!"

Reasoning:
The program does not have a validation check for the value of 'b'. If the value of 'b' is zero, the program will result in a division by zero error since the program is trying to divide 'num' by 'b' in order to determine the quotient. This will result in a test failure since the program will not be able to handle this situation and will not produce the correct output.
