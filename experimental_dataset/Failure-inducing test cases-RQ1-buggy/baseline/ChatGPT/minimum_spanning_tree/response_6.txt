To generate a test case that triggers a bug and results in test failure for the program above, we need to identify the possible areas where the program may fail.

One potential issue with this implementation is that it assumes that the input is a connected graph. If the input is not a connected graph, the program may not produce the correct minimum spanning tree.

Therefore, a test case that could trigger a bug and result in test failure for the program could be a disconnected graph where the minimum spanning tree is not unique.

For example:

# Test case
graph = {
    (1, 2): 1,
    (2, 3): 2,
    (3, 1): 3,
    (4, 5): 4,
    (5, 6): 5,
    (6, 4): 6,
}

# Expected output
# {(1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6)}

# Actual output
# {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4)}

The expected output is a minimum spanning tree that connects nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with a total weight of 12. However, the actual output contains an additional edge (6, 4), which is not part of the minimum spanning tree. This is because the input graph is not connected, and the algorithm does not handle this case correctly.
