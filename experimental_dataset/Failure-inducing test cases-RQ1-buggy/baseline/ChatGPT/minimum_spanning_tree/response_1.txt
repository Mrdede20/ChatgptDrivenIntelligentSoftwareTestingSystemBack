Test case:

weight_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 10,
    (1, 2): 5,
    (2, 3): 10,
    (3, 0): 5,
    (0, 2): 20,
    (1, 3): 20
}

# Intentional bug: should be weight_by_edge.__getitem__, but written as weight_by_edge.getitem
result = minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge.getitem)

# Expected output: {(1, 2), (0, 1), (2, 3)}

Explanation:

The intentional bug in the test case is the use of weight_by_edge.getitem instead of weight_by_edge.__getitem__ to access the weight of each edge. This will cause a AttributeError exception to be raised, as getitem is not a method of the dictionary class.

As a result, the program will fail to run and raise an exception, causing the test case to fail.
