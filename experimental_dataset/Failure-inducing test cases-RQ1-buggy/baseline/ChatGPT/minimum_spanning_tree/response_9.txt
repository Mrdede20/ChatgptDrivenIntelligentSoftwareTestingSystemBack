Test case:

weight_by_edge = {(1,2): 5, (1,3): 2, (2,3): 3, (3,4): 1, (4,5): 1, (5,6): 1, (6,7): 1, (7,8): 1, (8,9): 1, (9,10): 1, (10,11): 1, (11,12): 1, (12,13): 1, (13,14): 1, (14,15): 1, (15,16): 1, (16,17): 1, (17,18): 1, (18,19): 1, (19,20): 1, (20,21): 1, (21,22): 1, (22,23): 1, (23,24): 1, (24,25): 1, (25,26): 1, (26,27): 1, (27,28): 1, (28,29): 1, (29,30): 1, (30,31): 1, (31,32): 1, (32,33): 1, (33,34): 1, (34,35): 1, (35,36): 1, (36,37): 1, (37,38): 1, (38,39): 1, (39,40): 1, (40,41): 1, (41,42): 1, (42,43): 1, (43,44): 1, (44,45): 1, (45,46): 1, (46,47): 1, (47,48): 1, (48,49): 1, (49,50): 1}

Expected output:

{(3, 4), (4, 5), (2, 3), (1, 3), (7, 8), (9, 10), (6, 7), (5, 6), (11, 12), (13, 14), (15, 16), (17, 18), (19, 20), (21, 22), (23, 24), (25, 26), (27, 28), (29, 30), (31, 32), (33, 34), (35, 36), (37, 38), (39, 40), (41, 42), (43, 44), (45, 46), (47, 48), (49, 50)}

Explanation:

The above program implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. However, there is a bug in the code that causes it to fail for certain input cases.

The test case above is designed to trigger the bug. The input graph consists of 50 nodes, and each node is connected to its adjacent node by an edge of weight 1. The expected output is the set of edges that form the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

However, when the above test case is run with the minimum_spanning_tree function, the function returns an incorrect set of edges. Specifically, the function returns an empty set instead of the expected set of edges.

This bug is caused by the key parameter in the sorted function call. In the current implementation, the key function is weight_by_edge.__getitem__, which returns the weight of
