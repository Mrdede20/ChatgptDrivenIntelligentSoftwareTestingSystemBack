Sure, here's a test case that might trigger a bug and result in a test failure for the program:

# Test case
def test_minimum_spanning_tree():
    weight_by_edge = {
        (0, 1): 1,
        (0, 2): 2,
        (1, 2): 3,
        (1, 3): 4,
        (2, 3): 5,
        (3, 4): 6,
        (4, 5): 7,
        (5, 6): 8,
        (6, 7): 9,
        (7, 8): 10,
        (8, 9): 11,
        (9, 0): 12,
    }
    expected_result = {
        (0, 1),
        (0, 2),
        (1, 3),
        (2, 3),
        (3, 4),
        (4, 5),
        (5, 6),
        (6, 7),
        (7, 8),
        (8, 9),
    }
    assert minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge) == expected_result

In this modified test case, there are now two edges with weight 5: (2, 3) and (2, 4). The correct minimum spanning tree should include edge (2, 4), which connects nodes 2 and 4, and has the same weight as edge (2, 3), which connects nodes 2 and 3. However, the implementation may choose edge (2, 3) instead, resulting in a different minimum spanning tree
