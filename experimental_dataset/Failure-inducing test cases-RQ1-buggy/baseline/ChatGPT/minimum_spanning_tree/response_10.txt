Sure, here's an example test case that might trigger a bug in the minimum_spanning_tree function:

# Test Case
graph = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (0, 2): 2,
    (1, 2): 3,
    (1, 3): 4,
    (2, 3): 5,
    (2, 4): 6,
    (3, 4): 7,
    (3, 5): 8,
    (4, 5): 9
}

# expected result
expected_mst_edges = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)}

# call the function
actual_mst_edges = minimum_spanning_tree(graph)

# check the result
assert actual_mst_edges == expected_mst_edges, f"Expected {expected_mst_edges}, but got {actual_mst_edges}"

In this test case, the function sorts the edges by their weights and then starts building the minimum spanning tree. However, the function incorrectly selects edges (0, 1) and (0, 2) instead of (0, 1) and (1, 3).

The issue is caused by the fact that the function uses a set of edges (mst_edges) to keep track of the edges in the minimum spanning tree, and this set doesn't allow duplicate edges. When the function tries to add the edge (0, 2) to the set, it is not added because (0, 1) is already in the set. This causes the function to incorrectly assume that edge (0, 2) is not part of the minimum spanning tree.

To fix this issue, the function could use a list instead of a set to keep track of the edges in the minimum spanning tree.
