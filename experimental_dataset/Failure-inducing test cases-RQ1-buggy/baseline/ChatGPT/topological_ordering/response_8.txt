Test case:
nodes = [Node(value=1, successors=[Node(value=2), Node(value=3)]), Node(value=2, successors=[Node(value=3)], predecessors=[Node(value=1)])]

Expected result:
The topological ordering should be [Node(value=1), Node(value=2), Node(value=3)]

Actual result:
The topological ordering is [Node(value=1), Node(value=3), Node(value=2)]

Bug:
The program does not correctly handle nodes with multiple predecessors. In this test case, Node(value=2) should come after Node(value=1) in the ordering, but it is mistakenly placed after Node(value=3). This is because the program does not take into account the order of nodes in the predecessors list.
