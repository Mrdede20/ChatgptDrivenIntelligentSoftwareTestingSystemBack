Test case: 

Input: 

nodes = [Node(value=1, outgoing_nodes=[2]), Node(value=2, outgoing_nodes=[3]), Node(value=3, outgoing_nodes=[1])] 

Expected output: 

[ ] 

Explanation: 

This test case includes a circular dependency in the graph formed by the nodes, where node 1 has an outgoing edge to node 2, node 2 has an outgoing edge to node 3, and node 3 has an outgoing edge back to node 1. This cycle means that no topological ordering can be formed, and the function should return an empty list. 

However, the implementation of the function does not detect this cycle and continues to iterate over the graph, eventually resulting in an infinite loop and a test failure.
