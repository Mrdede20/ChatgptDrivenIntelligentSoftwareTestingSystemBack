Test case:

digit_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

Expected output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 1]

Explanation:

The input digit list has 10 digits and is not a palindrome. The next palindrome after this input should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 1]. However, the program will fail to produce the correct output due to an off-by-one error. Specifically, when high_mid is equal to low_mid, the function should increase digit_list[high_mid] by 1, but the current implementation skips this step. As a result, the function will return an incorrect output of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1].
