Test Case:

Input: [9, 9, 9, 9]
Expected Output: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation:
The input digit list is [9, 9, 9, 9] which is the highest possible value for a four-digit number. The expected output should be the next palindrome number after 9999, which is 10001.

However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this edge case properly. It enters an infinite loop and does not return any output. Thus, the test case will fail.

To trigger the bug, we can simply pass the input [9, 9, 9, 9] to the function and check that the output is not returned within a reasonable amount of time.
