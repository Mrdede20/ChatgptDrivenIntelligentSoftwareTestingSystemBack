Test case:

a = 1
b = 4
k = 2

Expected output: [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]

However, the program will fail to produce the expected output because of an off-by-one error in the for loop condition. The loop should iterate up to b + 1 - k, but it currently iterates up to b - k. This means that the final subsequence [3, 4] is not generated. 

To fix the bug, modify the range in line 4 to range(a, b + 2 - k):
