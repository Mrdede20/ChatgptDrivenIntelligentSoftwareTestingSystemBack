Test Case:
- Inputs: a=1, b=5, k=3
- Expected Output: [ [1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,2,5], [1,3,4], [1,3,5], [1,4,5], [2,3,4], [2,3,5], [2,4,5], [3,4,5] ]

However, if b and k are set such that there are not enough elements in the range [a, b] to create k length subsequences, the program will enter an infinite loop and fail the test. 

Test Case:
- Inputs: a=1, b=3, k=4
- Expected Output: []
- Actual Output: program enters an infinite loop and does not return any value. The test fails.
