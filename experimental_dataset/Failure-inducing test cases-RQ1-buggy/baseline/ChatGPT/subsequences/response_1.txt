Test Case:
a = 1
b = 5
k = 3

Expected Output:
[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 5], [1, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5]

Actual Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation:
The expected output is a list of all subsequences of length k that can be formed between a and b inclusive, in ascending order. However, the actual output is missing some subsequences and includes some extra subsequences. This indicates that the function is not correctly generating all the valid subsequences for the given inputs. Therefore, the function has failed the test case.
