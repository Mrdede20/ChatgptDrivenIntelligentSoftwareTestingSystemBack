Test Case: 

Initial Inputs: 
a = 1
b = 4
k = 0

Expected Output: 
[]

Actual Output: 
[]

Test Result: Pass


Test Case: 

Initial Inputs: 
a = 3
b = 8
k = 2

Expected Output: 
[[3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7], [6, 7]]

Actual Output: 
[[3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7], [6, 7]]

Test Result: Pass


Test Case:

Initial Inputs:
a = 0
b = -1
k = 3

Expected Output: 
[]

Actual Output: RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison 

Test Result: Fail

Explanation: 
Here, the range for the loop does not make sense because b+1-k is -3 which doesn't go into the loop. This leads to a recursive function which keeps on running until it exceeds the maximum recursion depth. Thus, this test case results in an error and the test fails. 

Thanks!
