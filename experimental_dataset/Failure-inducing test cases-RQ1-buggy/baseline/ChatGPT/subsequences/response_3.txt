Test case:

# Inputs:
a = 3
b = 6
k = 0

# Expected output:
[]

# Actual output:
[3, 4, 5, 6]

Explanation:

The program has a base case for k == 0, which should return an empty list. However, when k is set to 0 in the input, the program returns a list with all numbers from a to b, which is not the expected output. This is a bug in the program and the test case should fail.
