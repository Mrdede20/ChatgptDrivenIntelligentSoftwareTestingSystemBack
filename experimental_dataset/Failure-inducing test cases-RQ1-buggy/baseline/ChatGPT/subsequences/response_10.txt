Test Case:

Test Input:
- a = 1, b = 4, k = 2

Expected Output:
- [ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4] ]

Actual Output:
- [ [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3] ]

Explanation:
- The program should generate all possible subsequences of length k between a and b inclusive.
- The expected output shows all possible subsequences of length 2 between 1 and 4 inclusive.
- However, the actual output only shows a subset of the expected output.
- This indicates that the program is not generating all possible subsequences correctly and is therefore faulty.
