Test Case: 
subsequences(4, 2, 2)

Expected Output: 
An error message stating that a is greater than b, and the program cannot find subsequences.

Explanation: 
The program starts by iterating through a range of values between 'a' and 'b+1-k'. In this case, 'a' is 4, and 'b+1-k' would be 3. Therefore, there would be no values within the range to iterate over. This would result in an empty list being returned, which is not the expected output.
