Test Case:
a = 1
b = 5
k = 0

Expected Output:
[]

Actual Output:
[]

Test results: The program has passed the test case. 

Test Case:
a = 1
b = 5
k = 3

Expected Output:
[[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,2,5], [1,3,4], [1,3,5], [1,4,5], [2,3,4], [2,3,5], [2,4,5], [3,4,5]]

Actual Output:
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 6], [1, 4, 5], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5], [2, 3, 6], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6], [2, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 6], [3, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]

Test results: The program has failed the test case. 

Explanation: The actual output includes subsequence values that are greater than the range of b. For example, [1,3,6], [1,4,6], are not valid subsequences in the given range. This is a bug in the program.
