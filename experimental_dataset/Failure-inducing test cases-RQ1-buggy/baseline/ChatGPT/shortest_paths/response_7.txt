Test case:

Input:
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {
    ('A', 'B'): 2,
    ('B', 'C'): 4,
    ('C', 'D'): 5,
    ('D', 'E'): 1,
    ('E', 'F'): 3,
    ('F', 'A'): 1
}

Expected output:
{
    'A': 0,
    'B': 2,
    'C': 6,
    'D': 11,
    'E': 12,
    'F': 13
}

Test case explanation:
The input contains a graph with a cycle. The program is intended to compute the shortest path to all nodes from a given source, but when a cycle is present, it can result in an incorrect output. The expected output represents the correct shortest paths to all nodes.
