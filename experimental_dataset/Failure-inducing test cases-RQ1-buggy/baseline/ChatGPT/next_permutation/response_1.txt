Here's a test case that triggers a bug in the next_permutation function and results in a test failure:

# Test Case
perm = [3, 2, 1]
expected_output = None # The function is expected to return None if it cannot find the next permutation

# Execute the function
output = next_permutation(perm)

# Check if the output matches the expected output
assert output == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {output}"

The test case is testing the scenario where the input permutation is already in descending order, i.e., there is no next permutation. The next_permutation function is expected to return None in this case. However, the current implementation of the function doesn't handle this scenario correctly and will result in a IndexError: list index out of range error.
