Test case:

perm = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

This test case triggers a bug in the program when perm is the largest possible permutation of length 9 (i.e., [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]). The program should return None in this case because there is no larger permutation of perm. However, the program returns an incorrect permutation [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3].

Expected output:

None

Actual output:

[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3]
