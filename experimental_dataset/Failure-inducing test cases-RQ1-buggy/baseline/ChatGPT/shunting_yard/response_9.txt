Test Case:

Input: A list of tokens containing a combination of integers and operators (+, -, *, /) in an order that violates the operator precedence rule.

Expected Output: A list of tokens in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) that follows the operator precedence rule.

def test_shunting_yard():
    # Input test case
    tokens = [3, '*', 4, '+', 1, '/', 2]

    # Expected output test case
    expected_output = [3, 4, '*', 1, 2, '/', '+']

    # Call the function with the input test case
    output = shunting_yard(tokens)

    # Check if the output matches the expected output
    assert output == expected_output, "Test case failed: shunting_yard() returned unexpected output."
