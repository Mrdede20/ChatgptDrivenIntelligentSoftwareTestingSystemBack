The program above seems to have some issues with its implementation, particularly with the insert_or_update function. A possible test case to trigger a bug and result in a test failure could be:

# Test Case
length_by_edge = {
    'A': {'B': 2},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 3},
    'C': {'A': 4}
}
startnode = 'A'
goalnode = 'C'

# create nodes
A = Node(value='A', successors=['B'])
B = Node(value='B', successors=['C'], predecessors=['A'], incoming_nodes=['A'], outgoing_nodes=['C'])
C = Node(value='C', predecessors=['B'], incoming_nodes=['B'])

# insert nodes in a graph
graph = {
    'A': A,
    'B': B,
    'C': C
}

# check if shortest path length is correct
assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode) == 5

This test case creates a graph with three nodes A, B, and C, where A has a connection to B with a length of 2, B has connections to A and C with lengths of 1 and 3, respectively, and C has a connection to A with a length of 4. The starting node is A, and the goal node is C.

The test case will check whether the shortest_path_length function correctly returns the shortest path length from node A to node C, which is 5 in this case. However, since the insert_or_update function is not working correctly, it may fail to update the distance for a node in the priority queue, causing the algorithm to return an incorrect result.
