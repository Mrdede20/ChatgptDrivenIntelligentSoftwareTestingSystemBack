One possible test case that can trigger a bug and result in a test failure for the program above is as follows:

# Test case
def test_shortest_path_length():
    # Create nodes
    A = Node('A')
    B = Node('B')
    C = Node('C')

    # Set up connections between nodes
    A.successors = [B, C]
    B.successors = [C]

    # Set up length by edge
    length_by_edge = {(A, B): 1, (A, C): 2, (B, C): 1}

    # Test shortest path length
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, A, C) == 2

This test case creates three nodes A, B, and C, and sets up connections between them such that A is connected to B and C, and B is connected to C. The length by edge is set up such that the distance between A and B is 1, the distance between A and C is 2, and the distance between B and C is 1.

The expected shortest path length between A and C is 2, which can be verified manually by observing that the shortest path between A and C is A -> C with a distance of 2. However, the program may fail to compute the correct shortest path length due to a bug in the implementation.

One possible bug in the implementation is in the get function, which returns 0 instead of float('inf') when the node is not found in the heap. This could lead to incorrect shortest path lengths being computed when the distance to an unvisited node is 0 instead of float('inf'). To trigger this bug, we can modify the length by edge such that the distance between A and C is 0 instead of 2, and the expected shortest path length should be 1 instead of 2. The modified test case is as follows:

# Modified test case
def test_shortest_path_length():
    # Create nodes
    A = Node('A')
    B = Node('B')
    C = Node('C')

    # Set up connections between nodes
    A.successors = [B, C]
    B.successors = [C]

    # Set up length by edge
    length_by_edge = {(A, B): 1, (A, C): 0, (B, C): 1}

    # Test shortest path length
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, A, C) == 1

When this modified test case is run, it should fail because the program may compute the shortest path length between A and C as 0 instead of 1, due to the bug in the get function.
