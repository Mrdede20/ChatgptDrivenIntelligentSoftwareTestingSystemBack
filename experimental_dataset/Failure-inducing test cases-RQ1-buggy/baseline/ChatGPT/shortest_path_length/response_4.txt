The program appears to be incomplete and contains syntax errors. Specifically, the node_heap parameter in the insert_or_update() function is not defined, and the heappush() statement at the end of the program is outside any function. However, assuming that these issues are resolved, a test case that could trigger a bug and result in a test failure could be as follows:

# Test Case
# The graph consists of three nodes A, B, and C. 
# There is a directed edge from A to B with length 2, and a directed edge from B to C with length 1.
# The shortest path from A to C is through B, with a length of 2+1=3.

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 2},
    'B': {'C': 1},
    'C': {}
}
startnode = 'A'
goalnode = 'C'
length_by_edge = {}
for node in graph:
    for successor, length in graph[node].items():
        length_by_edge[(node, successor)] = length

result = shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode)
assert result == 3, f"Test Failed: Expected 3 but got {result}"

This test case creates a graph with three nodes and two directed edges, where the shortest path from startnode to goalnode is expected to have a length of 3. However, there is a bug in the program's implementation of insert_or_update(), which may cause nodes to be added to the node_heap multiple times, leading to incorrect shortest path calculations.
