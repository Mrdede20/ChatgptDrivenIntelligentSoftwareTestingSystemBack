# Test Case
# Test case with bug trigger

arr = [1, 2, 3]

# Expected Output:
# [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3], [1, 3, 2]]

assert powerset(arr) == [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3], [1, 3, 2,]]


# The expected output of the above test case is incorrect. 
# There is an extra comma after [1, 3, 2] in the expected output. This would cause the test case to fail. 

# The correct expected output should be:
# [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3], [1, 3, 2]]
