Here's a test case that can trigger a bug in the mergesort function:

arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

sorted_arr = mergesort(arr)

assert sorted_arr == [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]

This test case contains repeated elements, and the bug in the mergesort function is that it doesn't preserve the relative order of equal elements in the input array. As a result, the expected sorted array contains two occurrences of the number 1 in the wrong order, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the merge function should compare elements from the left and right subarrays using the less-than operator instead of the less-than-or-equal-to operator. This will ensure that the relative order of equal elements is preserved. Here's the corrected code for the merge function:

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:] or right[j:])
    return result
