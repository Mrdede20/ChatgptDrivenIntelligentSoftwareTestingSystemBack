Test case:

assert pascal(0) == []

Expected output: An empty list.

Actual output: [[1]]

Explanation: The function does not handle the case where n is equal to zero. When n equals zero, the function should return an empty list. However, the current implementation returns a list containing a single element, which is incorrect.
