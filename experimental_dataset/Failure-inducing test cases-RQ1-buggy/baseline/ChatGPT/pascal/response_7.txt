Test Case:

Input: n = 0
Expected Output: []

Explanation:
The expected output for an input of 0 is an empty list, as there are no rows in Pascal's triangle for n = 0. However, the current implementation of the pascal function returns a list containing a single row with a value of 1. Therefore, this test case will trigger a bug and result in a test failure.

Example Usage:

assert pascal(0) == []
