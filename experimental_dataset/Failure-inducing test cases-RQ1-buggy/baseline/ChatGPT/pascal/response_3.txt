Test case:

n = 0

Expected output:

[[1]]

Actual output:

IndexError: list index out of range

Explanation:

The for loop starts at r = 1, which means that if n = 0, the for loop will not execute, and the function will try to access an element in rows at index -1, which will result in an IndexError. To fix this bug, we can add a check for n = 0 at the beginning of the function and return [[1]] if n = 0.
