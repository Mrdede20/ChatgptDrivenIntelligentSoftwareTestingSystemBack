Test case:

arr = [3, 5, 2, 7, 1, 4]
expected_result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

# Shuffle the array to trigger the bug
import random
random.shuffle(arr)

# Call the function with shuffled array
result = quicksort(arr)

# Check if result is equal to the expected result
assert result == expected_result, f"Result: {result}. Expected: {expected_result}"


Bug description: 

The current implementation does not handle duplicate elements in the input array. If there are duplicate elements, the function may fail to sort them correctly and result in test failure.
