Test case:

```
arr = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]
result = quicksort(arr)
assert result == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This test case will trigger a bug because the expected result `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` includes the number 6 which is not present in the input array `arr`. The quicksort algorithm does not handle this case and will return a result with an extra number, resulting in a test failure.
