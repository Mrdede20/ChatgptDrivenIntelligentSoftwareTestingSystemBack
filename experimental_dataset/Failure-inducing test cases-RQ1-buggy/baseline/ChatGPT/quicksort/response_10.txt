Test Case:

arr = [4, 2, 8, 1, 9, 7]

Expected Output:

[1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9] (Sorted array)

Actual Output:

[1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

Explanation:

The code is missing the elements greater than the pivot element in the recursive call. Therefore, the element "9" is missing from the sorted array result, leading to a bug in the program.
