Test case:

arr = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7]
expected_output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
assert quicksort(arr) == expected_output

Explanation:

This test case will result in a failure because the quicksort function sorts the array in ascending order except if there are duplicates. In the given example, there is a duplicate element (2, and 2 > 1), so the quicksort function places it after the pivot (1) resulting in [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 2]. To fix the issue, we can modify the quicksort function to handle duplicate elements or remove them before sorting.
