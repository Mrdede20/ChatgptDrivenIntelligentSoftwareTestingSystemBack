Test case:
arr = [3, 5, 7, 9, 1]
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Bug: The implementation does not handle duplicate values in the array properly, leading to an infinite recursion.

Explanation: When the input array contains duplicates, the same value is compared twice with the pivot in subsequent recursive calls. This causes the same subarray to be passed for sorting again and again, resulting in an infinite recursion.

To trigger this bug, we can use the test case above with a duplicate value:
arr = [3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3]
Expected output: [1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 9] (Note the duplicated value)

This test case will cause the implementation to go into an infinite recursion and result in a test failure.
