Test case: 

Input: max = 1

Expected output: []

Actual output: []

Bug/Issue: The program does not check if the input value of max is less than 2. The current implementation will return an empty list for max = 1, but mathematically there are no prime numbers less than 2. 

Fix: Add a condition to check if max is less than 2 and return an appropriate error message. 

Revised code: 

def sieve(max):
    if max < 2:
        return "Invalid input"
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if any(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes
