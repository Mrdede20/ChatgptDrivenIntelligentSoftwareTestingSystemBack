Test case:

Input:
sieve(1)

Expected Output:
An empty list

Actual Output:
An empty list

Bug:
The program does not handle the case where the input value is less than 2. While there are no prime numbers less than 2, the function should return a message informing users of this instead of returning an empty list.
