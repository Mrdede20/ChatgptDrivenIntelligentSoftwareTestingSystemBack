Test Case:
sieve(1)

Expected Result:
The function should return an empty list because there are no prime numbers less than or equal to 1.

Actual Result:
The function returns [2]. This is incorrect because 2 is not a prime number less than or equal to 1. This test case triggers a bug in the program and results in test failure.
