Test case:
Input: sieve(1) 

Expected output: []

Actual output: Error: IndexError: list index out of range

Explanation: 
The input max value is 1 which should return an empty list as there are no primes between 2 and 1. However, the program tries to execute the for-loop with n=2 which results in an empty primes list leading to an index out of range error. This bug is triggered for input values less than 2 and will result in test failure as the expected and actual output do not match.
