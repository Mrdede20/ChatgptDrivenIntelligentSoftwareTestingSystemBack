Expected Output:

[]

Actual Output:

File "main.py", line 3, in sieve
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
ValueError: range() arg 2 must not be zero

The program should have returned an empty list as the input is invalid and the range in the for loop cannot be initiated, but the program has resulted in an error instead. This indicates a bug in the program.
