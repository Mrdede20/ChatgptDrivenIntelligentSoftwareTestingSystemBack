Test Case:
test_wrap_with_negative_cols_value()

Test Description:
This test case is designed to check the edge case where cols value is a negative integer. The expected result is a ValueError exception indicating that the value of cols should be greater than zero.


```
def test_wrap_with_negative_cols_value():
    text = "This is a long text that needs to be wrapped"
    cols = -5
    try:
        wrap(text, cols)
        assert False, "Test case failed, no exception was raised"
    except ValueError:
        assert True
```
