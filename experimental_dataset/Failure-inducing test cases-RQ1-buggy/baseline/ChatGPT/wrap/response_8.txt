Test Case:
Input: 
text = "This is a sample text"
cols = 5 

Expected Output:
['This', 'is a', 'sampl', 'e', 'text']

Actual Output:
['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text']

Explanation:
The actual output does not match the expected output. The bug is in the line where the text is sliced (line, text = text[:end], text[end:]). The slice is being taken from 0 to end, which includes the space character. Therefore, the slice should be taken from 0 to end-1.
