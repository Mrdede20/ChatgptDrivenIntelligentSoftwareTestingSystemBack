Test Case:

text = "This is a sentence which is longer than the specified column width"
cols = 10

Expected Output:

['This is a', ' sentence', ' which is', ' longer th', 'an the sp', 'ecified c', 'olumn wid', 'th']

Actual Output:

['This is a', ' sentence', ' which is', ' longer', ' than the', ' specified', ' column', ' width']

Test Result:

The program fails to wrap the text correctly when the last word of a line exceeds the specified column width. This test case results in a test failure as the actual output does not match the expected output.
