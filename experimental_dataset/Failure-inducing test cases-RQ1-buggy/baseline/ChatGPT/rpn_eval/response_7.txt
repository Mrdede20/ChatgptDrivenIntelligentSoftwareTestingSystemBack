Test case:

tokens = [1, 2, '+', 3, '*']
expected_output = 9

Explanation:

This test case uses the input tokens [1, 2, '+', 3, '*'] to test the rpn_eval function. The expected output is 9 because this expression translates to (1 + 2) * 3.

However, there is a bug in the op function that causes division by zero error when the operator is '/'. Since the input tokens do not contain the '/' operator, the program will not fail for this particular input.

To trigger the bug, we can modify the test case as follows:

tokens = [1, 0, '/', 3, '*']
expected_output = 0

In this modified test case, we have added the '/' operator with a zero operand, which should result in a division by zero error. The expected output is 0 because any calculation involving 0 should result in 0.
