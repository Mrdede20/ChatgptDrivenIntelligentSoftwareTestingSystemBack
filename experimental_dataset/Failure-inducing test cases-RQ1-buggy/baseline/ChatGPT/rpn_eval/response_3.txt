Test case:

tokens = [2, 3, 4, '+', '*']

Explanation:

The test case above evaluates the expression 2 * (3 + 4) using reverse Polish notation (RPN). The expected output is 14.0, but the function will return 5.0.

This is because the op function is popping the operands in the wrong order. In the case of the addition operation, it should be b + a instead of a + b. This means that in the test case above, the op function will be evaluated as op('+', 4, 3), which will return 7.0. Then, when the multiplication operation is applied, it will be evaluated as op('*', 7.0, 2), which will return 14.0. However, the function will instead return 5.0, which is the result of evaluating 2 * 3 - 4 instead.
