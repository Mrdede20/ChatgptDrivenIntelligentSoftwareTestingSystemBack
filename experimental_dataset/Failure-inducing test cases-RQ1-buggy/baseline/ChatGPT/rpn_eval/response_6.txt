One possible test case that could trigger a bug and cause a test failure in the program is:

tokens = [1, 2, 3, '+', '*', 4, '/']
assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 2.5

This test case is using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to evaluate an arithmetic expression that consists of multiplication, addition, and division operations.

The expected result of this expression is 2.5 (computed as (1 + 2 * 3) / 4). However, the implementation of the rpn_eval function uses the wrong order of operands when calling the op function for the multiplication and addition operations. Specifically, it pops the operands a and b from the stack in the wrong order. This results in the multiplication and addition operations being evaluated with the wrong operands, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the op function should swap the order of its operands for the multiplication and addition operations:

def op(symbol, a, b):
    return {
        '+': lambda a, b: a + b,
        '-': lambda a, b: a - b,
        '*': lambda a, b: b * a, # fix: swap the order of operands
        '/': lambda a, b: a / b
    }[symbol](a, b)
