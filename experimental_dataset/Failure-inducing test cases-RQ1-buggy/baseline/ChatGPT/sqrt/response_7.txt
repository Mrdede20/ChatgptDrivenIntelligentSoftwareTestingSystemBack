Test Case:

Input: x = 9, epsilon = 0.001
Expected Output: 3.00009155413138
Actual Output: 3

Explanation:

The program uses the Babylonian method to calculate the square root of a given number x with a given accuracy epsilon.

In this test case, we are testing the function with input value x = 9, epsilon = 0.001. The expected output is 3.00009155413138.

However, the actual output is 3, which is incorrect.

This failure occurs because the program does not handle inputs with very small epsilon values properly. When epsilon is very small, the loop condition abs(x - approx) > epsilon becomes true for a longer time, resulting in more iterations. Eventually, the approx value gets stuck at a value slightly lower than the actual square root. As a result, the final output is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the program should use a different condition for stopping the loop, such as a maximum number of iterations.
