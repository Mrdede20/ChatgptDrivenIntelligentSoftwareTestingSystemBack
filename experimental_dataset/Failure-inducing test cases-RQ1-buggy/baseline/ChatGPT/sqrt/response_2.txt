Test Case: 

sqrt(5, 0.0001)

Expected Outcome: 

The function should return the square root approximation of 5 with a max error tolerance of 0.0001.

Actual Outcome: 

The function fails to return the expected output and instead falls into an infinite loop. This is because the initial approximation value for 5 (2.5) is greater than the actual square root of 5, resulting in the while loop never being exited. 

Test Result: FAILED
