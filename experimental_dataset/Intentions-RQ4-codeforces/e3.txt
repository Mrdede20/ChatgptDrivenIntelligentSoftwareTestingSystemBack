This code defines a class `Solution` that contains a method `BinaryInversions`. The method takes two arguments - an integer `n` and a list `bits` of n integers. It returns the maximum number of inversions that can be performed on the given binary sequence, where an inversion is defined as the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and bits[i] > bits[j]. 

To solve the problem, the code first creates two modified versions of the input list - `first` and `second`. The `first` list is obtained by flipping the first zero encountered in the original list, and the `second` list is obtained by flipping the last one encountered in the original list. 

Next, the code calculates the inversion count for each of the three sequences - `orig`, `first`, and `second`. This is done by scanning the lists from right to left and counting the number of zeros encountered before the current position for each list. 

Finally, the code returns the maximum of the three inversion counts.
