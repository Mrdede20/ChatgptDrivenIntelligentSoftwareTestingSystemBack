This code seems to be solving a problem related to the selection of "mid" numbers from a given list "A" of size "n". The problem can be defined with the following input:

- The first line of input contains an integer "t", the number of test cases.

- For each test case, there are three space-separated integers "n","c", and "d", which represent the size of list A, the cost constraint "c", and the number of elements to be selected "d".

- The next line of input contains "n" space-separated integers that represent the elements of the given list.

The output of the code for each test case is a single integer, the maximum number of groups of "mid" consecutive numbers from A that can be selected such that the total cost is less than "c". 

If it is impossible to select "mid" numbers that satisfy the cost constraint, the code prints "Impossible". If no such number of groups is possible, it prints "Infinity".
