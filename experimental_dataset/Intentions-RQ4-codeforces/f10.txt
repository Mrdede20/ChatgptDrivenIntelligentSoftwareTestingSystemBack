This code calculates the maximum number of selections a user can make from a given list of elements A such that the total value of the selected elements is greater than or equal to c.

The input consists of several test cases, and for each test case, the program takes three values n, c, and d. Here, n is the number of elements in the input list A, c is the target amount, and d is the maximum number of selections that can be made. The code then takes input the elements of the list A and sorts it in descending order.

Next, it checks if the sum of the top d elements in A is greater than or equal to c and prints "Infinity". If the maximum value in A multiplied by d is less than c, it prints "Impossible". Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the largest possible mid value such that sum(A[:mid+1]) multiplied by the number of times d can be divided by '(mid+1)' plus the sum of the remaining values is greater than or equal to C.

Finally, it prints the value of mid-1.
