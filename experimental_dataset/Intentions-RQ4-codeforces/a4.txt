This code prompts the user to enter an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the user then inputs three space-separated integers. The program then sorts those three integers and prints the middle integer, which is the second integer after sorting. 

This is repeated until `t` becomes 1. The code essentially finds the median of three numbers entered for `t` number of test cases.
