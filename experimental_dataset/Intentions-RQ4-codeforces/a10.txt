The given code takes an integer as input and then enters into a loop. In each iteration of the loop, it accepts three integers as space-separated input and sorts them. Then, it prints the second smallest number among those three. After that, the loop variable `t` is decremented by 1. This process is repeated until `t` becomes less than or equal to 1.

In summary, the code takes multiple test cases, each containing three integers, and prints the second smallest value among them.
