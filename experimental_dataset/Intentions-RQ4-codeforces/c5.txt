This program takes as input an integer t, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes as input an integer n and a list of n integers called s. For each test case, it then finds the two maximum elements of the list s (represented by mx[0] and mx[1]) and prints out the list s with each element replaced by the difference between that element and the *smaller* of the two maximum elements. This is done for each test case, and each set of differences is printed on a new line.
