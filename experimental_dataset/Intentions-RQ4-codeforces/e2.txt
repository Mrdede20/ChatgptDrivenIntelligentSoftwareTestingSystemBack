This Python code defines a class called `Solution` which contains a method called `BinaryInversions`. The method takes two arguments, `n` and `bits`, where `n` is an integer and `bits` is a list of `n` integers. The method first creates three copies of the `bits` list, namely, `first`, `second`, and `orig`. Then it sets two Boolean variables `hasFirst` and `hasSecond` to `True`, and enters a loop which iterates through the list `bits`. If `hasFirst` is `True` and the current `bits` item is `0`, it sets the `first` value to `1` and sets `hasFirst` to `False`. It does the same operation for `second` but working with items from the end of the list to the beginning.

After that, the code computes the number of inversions for each possible list: `orig`, `first`, and `second`. This involves iterating through the list in reverse order; when encountering a `0`, it increments a counter for that list (`orig_zeros`, `first_zeros`, or `second_zeros`) and, if encountering a `1`, it adds the current counter value to the sum for that list (`orig_sum`, `first_sum`, or `second_sum`). Finally, the method returns the maximum value among `orig_sum`, `first_sum`, and `second_sum`.

The code also reads an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases that follow. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `bits`, and prints the result of calling the `BinaryInversions` method with those inputs.
