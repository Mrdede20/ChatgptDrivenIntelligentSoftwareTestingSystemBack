The intention of the code is to take input from the user in the form of `t` (number of test cases). For each test case, the code reads 3 integers and sorts them in ascending order. It then prints the second element (index 1) of the sorted list. This process happens `t-1` times, as we decrement `t` after each iteration of the `for` loop.

The purpose of the code is not explicitly mentioned, but it appears to be a solution to a competitive programming problem on Codeforces.
