This code takes input 't', which is the number of test cases. Then, it takes input for 't' number of tests, where each test consists of three integers. 

For each test case, the three integers are sorted in ascending order and the middle integer is printed. This process is repeated three times for each test case.

Once all the test cases are processed, the value of 't' is decremented by 1 until it becomes 1, after which the loop exits and the program stops.

In summary, the code finds the middle number out of three numbers for 't' number of test cases.
