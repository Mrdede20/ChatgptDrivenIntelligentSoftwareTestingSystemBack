This program reads input integers from standard input `stdin`, performs some operations to find the maximum number of inversions in three scenarios and output the result for each input integer to the standard output `stdout`. The program defines a class `Solution` and a method called `BinaryInversions` which takes an integer `n` and a list of binary digits (0's and 1's) as inputs. The `BinaryInversions` method returns the maximum number of inversions that can be obtained by modifying the input bits in three different scenarios: the original bits, bits where the first 0 is inverted to 1, and bits where the last 1 is inverted to 0. Then the program creates an instance of the `Solution` class and reads the input integers from the standard input. Finally, the program prints the maximum number of inversions to the standard output through the `stdout` object.
