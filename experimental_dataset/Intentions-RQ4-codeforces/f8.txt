This code seems to solve a problem where we have given an array A of size n, and coins c and we can select d maximum elements we have to select a subset of A that contains d maximum elements. We can select elements from A repeatedly to form a new array B of length d.

The goal is to select such array B of length d such that the sum of the elements in the array B is the maximum and we can get the sum of the array B greater than or equals to c using the minimum number of selections.

This code uses binary search to find the maximum value of the number of elements to be repeated to generate the array B. If the sum of the top d elements of A is greater than or equal to c, then we can select all the top d elements of A in one go and return infinity as an output.

If the sum of the highest-value element of A multiplied by d is less than c, then it's impossible to make such B, so we return impossible.

Otherwise, we perform binary search to find the maximum number of times we need to repeat the top x elements (where x is given by mid) to get the required sum and select the elements optimally.
