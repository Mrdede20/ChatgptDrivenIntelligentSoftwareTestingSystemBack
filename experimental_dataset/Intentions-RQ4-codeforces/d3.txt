This is a code to solve a problem on codeforces. The problem asks you to find out whether the given sequence has any non-trival valleys, which is a pair of integers b and e (1 ≤ b < e ≤ n), such that lb - 1 > lb (if b - 1 > 0), le + 1 > le (if e + 1 ≤ n) and all integers between b and e strictly larger than the two neighbouring ones. If such valley exist the output should be 'YES' otherwise it should be a 'NO'.
