No, the two programs will always generate the same output for the same input values. Both programs implement the same recursive algorithm to generate the list of moves for Tower of Hanoi. The difference is in the implementation of data structures (use of PriorityQueue vs calculation of intermediate pole position) and the way the pairs are implemented. The first program uses a custom Pair class while the second program uses the Pair class from the javafx.util package.
