It depends on the implementation of the Node class and its `getSuccessors()` or `getNeighbors()` method. If these methods return the same set of nodes in the same order for both programs, then the output will be the same. But if there is any difference in the set of nodes returned or order of nodes returned, then the output of the two programs may differ. Therefore, you need to provide a specific test case to check if the two programs have different outputs.
