No, both the programs are the solutions for Tower of Hanoi problem and they will give the same output for the same input. The only difference is the implementation of the solution. The first implementation uses a priority queue to determine the intermediate pole, while the second implementation determines the intermediate pole using a mathematical formula. However, this difference does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
