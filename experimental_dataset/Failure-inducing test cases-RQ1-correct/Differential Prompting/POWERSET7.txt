The two programs appear to be similar in function and output the same results for the inputs that I have tried. However, there are some differences in the implementation such as the use of generics and the importing of the ArrayList and List classes. It is possible that these implementation differences may cause some discrepancies with certain inputs. If you have a specific test case in mind, I can help you try both programs and compare their outputs.
