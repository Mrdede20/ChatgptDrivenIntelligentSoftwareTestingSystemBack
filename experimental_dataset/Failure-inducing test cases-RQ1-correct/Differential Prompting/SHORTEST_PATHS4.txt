It is not possible to answer this question without knowing the contents of the imported classes `Node` and `WeightedEdge`. However, assuming the two programs are both correct implementations of different shortest path algorithms (one using a double loop and the other using Dijkstra's algorithm), they should produce the same output given the same inputs.
