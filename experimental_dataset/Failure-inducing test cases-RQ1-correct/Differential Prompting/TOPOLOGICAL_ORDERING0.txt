Yes, there is. The two programs have different implementations and use different data structures to store and manipulate the directed graph. `TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING` uses `Node` from a different package while `TopologicalSort` has a private `Node` class defined within. Also, `TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING` uses an `ArrayList` data structure for `orderedNodes`, while `TopologicalSort` uses its own custom `ArrayList` class (`import .util.ArrayList`). This means that certain edge cases may produce different results due to differences in how the programs handle edge cases or represent the directed graph.
