There is a difference in the loop indices in both programs. The first program loops from 0 to `numNodes-1` whereas the second program loops from 1 to `numNodes`. This would cause the first vertex (0th vertex) to be ignored in the second program, leading to a different output for certain inputs.

To demonstrate this, consider the following input:
```
numNodes = 3
length_by_edge = { [0,1]:2, [1,2]:1 }
```
For this input, the first program outputs:
```
{[0, 0]=0, [0, 1]=2, [0, 2]=3, [1, 0]=99999, [1, 1]=0, [1, 2]=1, [2, 0]=99999, [2, 1]=99999, [2, 2]=0}
```
while the second program outputs:
```
{[1, 1]=0, [1, 2]=1, [1, 3]=2147483647, [2, 1]=2147483647, [2, 2]=0, [2, 3]=2147483647, [3, 1]=2147483647, [3, 2]=2147483647, [3, 3]=0}
```
As seen, the two outputs are different.
