There seems to be a mistake in the second program where the method is not declared to belong in any class. Here's a corrected version that should be equivalent to the first program:

```java
public class ReverseLinkedList {
    public static Node reverseLinkedList(Node head) {
        Node prev = null;
        Node curr = head;
        Node next = null;
        while (curr != null) {
            next = curr.getSuccessor();
            curr.setSuccessor(prev);
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

As for the original question, given the same input linked list, these two programs should always produce the same output.
