Yes, there is a possibility that the output of the two programs can differ if there is a cycle in the directed graph. The first program does not check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph whereas the second program detects and throws an exception if there is a cycle. Therefore, in cases where there is a cycle in the directed graph, the first program will provide an output whereas the second program will throw an exception indicating a cycle is present.
