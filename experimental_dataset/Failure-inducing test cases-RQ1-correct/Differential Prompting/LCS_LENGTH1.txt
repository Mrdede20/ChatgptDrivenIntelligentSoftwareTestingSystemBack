No, there is no input that makes the two programs have identical output.

Both programs calculate the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two given strings. However, they use different algorithms to find the LCS. The first program uses a recursive approach with memoization, which stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, while the second program uses a dynamic programming approach to fill in a table with the length of the LCS of all possible substrings.

Although the two algorithms are guaranteed to return the same result for any input, the time and space complexity of the algorithms can vary significantly for different inputs, and thus the programs can differ in their running time and memory usage.
