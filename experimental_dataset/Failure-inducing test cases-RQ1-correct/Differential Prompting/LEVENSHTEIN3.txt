Yes, there are inputs which can make the two programs have different output. Here is an example input:
```
String source = "abcd";
String target = "dcba";
```
The first program will return a Levenshtein distance of 4, while the second program will return a Levenshtein distance of 4 as well. However, for the input:
```
String source = "kraken";
String target = "breaker";
```
the first program will return a Levenshtein distance of 3, while the second program will return a Levenshtein distance of 2.
