No, both programs achieve the same functionality to convert a decimal number to a number with a given base using the provided character set ("0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"). They both use a while loop to repeatedly get the modulus of the number, divide the number by the base, and add the appropriate character to the result until the number is zero. The only difference is the use of a StringBuilder in the second program instead of concatenation with String.valueOf.
