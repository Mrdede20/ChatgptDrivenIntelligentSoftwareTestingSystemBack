There is a difference in the imports used in the two programs. 

The first program uses the import statement: 
```java
import java.util.*;
```

while the second program uses:
```java
import .util.ArrayList;
```

The second program assumes that the ArrayList used will always be from the package `.util`. If someone uses a different package name, the code will not compile. 

So, if someone uses the FLATTEN program with a different package name for ArrayList, the two programs will have different output.
