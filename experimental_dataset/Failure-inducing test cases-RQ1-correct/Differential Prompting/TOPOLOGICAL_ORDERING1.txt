Yes, there could be an input that results in different outputs for the two programs. 

The first program `TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING` uses a depth-first search-like algorithm while the second program `TopologicalSort` uses a breadth-first search like algorithm. For most directed acyclic graphs, both methods should work and produce the same topological ordering. 

However, for certain graphs, one algorithm might work better than the other, or even fail. Therefore, depending on the specific input directed graph, there is a possibility that the topological ordering output by both algorithms is different.
