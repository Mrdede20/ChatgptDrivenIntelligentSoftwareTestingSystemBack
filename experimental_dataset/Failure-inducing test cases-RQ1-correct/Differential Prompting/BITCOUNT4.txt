No, both programs are implementing the same algorithm for counting the number of set bits in the binary representation of a non-negative integer. The only difference is in the condition for termination of the while loop. While the first program checks for n not equal to 0, the second program checks for n greater than 0. However, since both conditions are equivalent for any non-negative integer, the two programs should always produce the same output for any input.
