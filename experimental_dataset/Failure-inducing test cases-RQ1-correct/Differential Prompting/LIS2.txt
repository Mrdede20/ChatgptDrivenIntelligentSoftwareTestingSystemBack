Yes, there are inputs for which the two programs may have different outputs. Here's an example test case:

```
int[] arr = {4, 2, 3, 1, 5};
```

The LIS of this array is 3, which can be achieved by selecting the subsequence [2, 3, 5]. However, the two programs may produce different results for this input. The first program uses a dynamic programming approach that maintains a map of the ends of the increasing subsequences seen so far. When processing the last element of the input array (5), the map will contain the following entries:

```
{1=0, 2=2, 3=4}
```

This indicates that there's an increasing subsequence of length 1 that ends at index 0, one of length 2 that ends at index 2, and one of length 3 that ends at index 4. Therefore, the LIS is 3.

On the other hand, the second program uses a different dynamic programming approach that iteratively calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array. After processing the same input array, the value of dp array will be:

```
{1, 1, 2, 1, 3}
```

This means that there's an increasing subsequence of length 1 ending at index 0, one of length 1 ending at index 1, one of length 2 ending at index 2, and so on. Therefore, the LIS is still 3, but computed in a different way.
