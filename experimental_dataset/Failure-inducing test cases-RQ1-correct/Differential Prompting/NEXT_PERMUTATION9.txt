Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. 

A possible test case is inputting an ArrayList with repeated integers, for example, [1,3,2,2]. 

The first program will output [2, 2, 1, 3], which is incorrect, while the second program will output [2, 2, 3, 1], which is the correct next permutation.
