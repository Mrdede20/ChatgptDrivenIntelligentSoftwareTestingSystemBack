Yes, there could be an input that makes the two programs give different outputs. This is because they have different implementations for finding the next permutation in a given list of integers. The first program follows a traditional approach of swapping elements and reversing the remainder of the list, whereas the second program uses library functions to achieve the same result. Therefore, they might behave differently for certain inputs. 

Here's an example input that would make the two programs give different outputs:
```
Input: [1, 3, 2]
Expected output for first program: [2, 1, 3]
Expected output for second program: [2, 3, 1]
```
The first program will swap the last two elements and reverse the remaining sublist to get the next permutation. The second program, on the other hand, will swap the first and last elements and reverse the remainder of the sublist, thus giving a different result.
