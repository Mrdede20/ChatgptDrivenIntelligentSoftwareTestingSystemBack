Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here's an example input:

ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6));
int k = 3;

With this input, the output of KHEAPSORT will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], while the output of KHeapSort will be [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7]. 

The reason for the difference is that KHEAPSORT maintains a single priority queue for all elements, while KHeapSort maintains multiple priority queues - one for the first k elements, and another for the remaining elements. This causes a slight difference in the way the elements are sorted and inserted into the sorted list.
