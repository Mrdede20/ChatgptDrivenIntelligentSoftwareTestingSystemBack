No, these two programs are equivalent and give the same output for any input n. The first program is implemented recursively and the second program is implemented iteratively, but the logic and algorithmic steps are the same. Both programs find the prime factors of a given integer n and return them in an ArrayList. The output for input n=24 is [2, 2, 2, 3] for both programs.
