To answer your question, it's not possible to determine if there is an input that would make the two programs output different results as we do not have access to the `Node` class and its methods `getSuccessors()` and `getNeighbors()`. However, we can see that the two programs are similar in that they both implement a breadth-first search algorithm to search for a `goalNode` starting from a `startNode`. The main difference is that the first program uses a `Deque` while the second program uses a `Queue`.
