Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs output different results. The difference comes from how the start and end indices are handled.

The first program uses a recursion approach to divide the array in half on each call, where the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. This means that on the final call, the end index will be equal to the start index and the function will return -1. However, in the second program, the while loop runs until the left index is greater than the right index, so in the case where the target value is not found in the array, the left index will end up being one greater than the last valid index (i.e. arr.length), causing the function to return -1 for an input where the target value is actually present in the array. 

Here is an example test case where the outputs are different:

```java
int[] arr = {1, 3, 5};
int target = 5;
int result1 = FIND_IN_SORTED.find_in_sorted(arr, target); // returns 2
int result2 = find_in_sorted(arr, target); // returns -1
```
