Yes, there are inputs that will make the two programs have different outputs. Here's a sample input:

```java
String a = "abcdeb";
String b = "bcedba";
```

The first program uses a "top-down" approach (i.e., recursively), while the second one uses a "bottom-up" approach (i.e., iteratively). Because of this difference, the two programs may have different outputs for certain inputs.
