Yes, there can be an input that produces different outputs for the two programs. This can happen when there are repeated elements in the input array. The first program can count repeated elements as part of the longest increasing subsequence, while the second program only counts unique elements. Here's an example input:

int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 4, 2};

The first program will return a length of 4, as the longest increasing subsequence is {1, 3, 4}. The second program will return a length of 3, as the longest increasing subsequence is {1, 3, 4}, but the repeated element 2 is not counted.
