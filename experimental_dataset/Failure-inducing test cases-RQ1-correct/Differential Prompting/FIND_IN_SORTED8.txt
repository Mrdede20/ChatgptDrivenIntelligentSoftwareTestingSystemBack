No, both programs are implementing the same algorithm – binary search. The only difference is in the implementation of the binary search algorithm – one is using recursion, and the other one is using iteration. However, the logic remains the same, and as long as the input array is sorted, they will always produce the same output. 

As for the test case in Java, you can use the following:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

public class TestFindInSorted {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
        int x = 5;
        System.out.println(FIND_IN_SORTED.find_in_sorted(arr, x)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(find_in_sorted(arr, x)); // Output: 2
    }
}
``` 

This test case should output '2' for both programs, indicating that they are producing the same output for the same input.
