Yes, there could be an input that makes the two programs have different output.

For example, consider the input `perm = [1, 1, 5]`. The first program would return `[1, 5, 1]`, while the second program would return `[5, 1, 1]`.

The reason for this difference is that in the first program, the implementation does not consider the case where there are repeated elements in the input array. In the example input, after the first swap, the resulting array is `[1, 5, 1]`. However, this is not the actual next permutation - the correct next permutation for this input would be `[5, 1, 1]`.

On the other hand, the second program makes use of `Collections.swap` and `Collections.reverse`, which are methods that handle repeated elements correctly. Hence, the second implementation gives the correct next permutation for the input array `[1, 1, 5]`.
