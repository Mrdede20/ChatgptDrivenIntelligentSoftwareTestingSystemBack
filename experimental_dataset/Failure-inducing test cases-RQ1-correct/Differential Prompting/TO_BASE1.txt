No, both programs perform the same logic to convert a number to a specified base. Both methods take two arguments, an integer `num` and a base `b`. The methods then iterate over `num` and append the appropriate characters to the result string. The only difference is that the first program uses string concatenation with `+` inside the loop, which can be slower, while the second program uses a `StringBuilder` to efficiently append each character.
