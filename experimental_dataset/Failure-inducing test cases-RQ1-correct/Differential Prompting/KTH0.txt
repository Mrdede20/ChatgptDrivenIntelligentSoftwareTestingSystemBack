Yes, there could be inputs that make these programs behave differently since they use different algorithms to find the k-th element in an ArrayList. Specifically, the first solution is using quickselect (a variant of quicksort) to recursively partition the list until it narrows down to the k-th element, whereas the second solution uses the partition function of quickselect to iteratively partition the list until it finds the k-th element. As a result, the order of the elements in the input list could affect the performance of these algorithms and the results they return.
