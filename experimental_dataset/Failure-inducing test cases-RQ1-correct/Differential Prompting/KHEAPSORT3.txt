Yes, the two programs may have different output for some inputs. Specifically, the difference lies in the fact that the first program uses a single priority queue to maintain the k smallest elements and then sorts the remaining elements, while the second program creates a priority queue of size k and sorts it after polling all the elements from the input list. This may lead to different ordering of elements for certain inputs. 

Here's an example input that causes the two programs to produce different outputs:

```
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 4));
int k = 3;
```

For this input, the first program would output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, while the second program would output `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]`.
