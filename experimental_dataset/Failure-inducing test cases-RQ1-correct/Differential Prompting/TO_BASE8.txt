No, both programs implement the same logic of converting a given number to a given base. They both use the same algorithm which is to repeatedly divide the given number and collect the remainders until the number is zero. The remainders give the digits of the new base number in reverse order. They are then combined to give the final result. The only difference is that the second program uses a StringBuilder to build the result rather than a String, which might be more efficient for large numbers.
