Yes, there is a possible input that can make these two programs output different results. The reason is that the `topologicalSort` method of the `TopologicalSort` class keeps removing nodes with incoming degree 0 and adding their successors to a temporary list, while the `topological_ordering` method of the `TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING` class adds nodes that have no predecessors to the ordered list and then iterates over that list, adding every node's successors that have no predecessors left to the ordered list. 

Due to these differences in implementation, the results might differ depending on the input graph structure. For example, if there are several disconnected sub-graphs in the input graph, their ordering might be different in the output of the programs, depending on the order of traversal.
