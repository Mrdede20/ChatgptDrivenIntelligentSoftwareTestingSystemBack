Yes, there are test cases that produce different output for these two programs. 

Here is one such test case: 

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output for the first program: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]

Output for the second program: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

As you can see, the order of the last two elements is different in the two programs. This is because the algorithms they use to generate the next permutation are different.
