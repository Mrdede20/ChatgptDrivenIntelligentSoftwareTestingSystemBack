Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different outputs. 

Consider the case where `capacity=0` and `items={{0,0},{0,0},{0,0}}`. The first program will correctly return `0`, as all items have weight of `0`, and the maximum value achievable with zero capacity is `0`.

However, the second program will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the loop in line 7 will initialize `memo[0][0]` to 0, and then the loop in line 9 will try to access `memo[i-1][j-weight]`, which is `memo[0][-1]` and will cause the exception. This occurs because the loop in the second program starts from `i=1` and `j= 1` which causes incorrect initialization of `memo[0][0]`.

Therefore, the two programs have different behavior for this input, demonstrating the importance of testing and checking corner cases before finalizing optimized code.
