Yes, the input can be a graph that has nodes represented by integers, and the edge distances are not equal for each direction between two nodes. For example, consider the following graph:

```
   +--- 1 ---+
   |         |
   3         1
   |         |
   +--- 2<---+
```

The above graph can be represented as a map in the following way in both programs:

``` java
Map<String, Map<String, Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
graph.put("1", new HashMap<String, Integer>() {{
    put("2", 1);
    put("3", 3);
}});
graph.put("2", new HashMap<String, Integer>() {{
    put("1", 1);
}});
graph.put("3", new HashMap<String, Integer>() {{
    put("1", 3);
}});
```

However, in `SHORTEST_PATH_LENGTH` program, the length of the edges are represented through a `Map` with keys as a `List<Node>` containing two nodes in order, and their distances as values. Hence, the edge lengths may be different for each direction of the edge when compared to the opposite direction. For the above graph, it can be represented as follows:

``` java
Map<List<Node>, Integer> length_by_edge = new HashMap<>();
length_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList(new Node(1), new Node(2)), 1);
length_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList(new Node(1), new Node(3)), 3);
length_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList(new Node(2), new Node(1)), 1);
length_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList(new Node(3), new Node(1)), 2);
```

In the above representation, the edge lengths between node 1 and node 3 are different in each direction. Therefore, the two programs may produce different results on this input.
