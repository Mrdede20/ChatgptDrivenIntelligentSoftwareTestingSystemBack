Yes, there is a possibility that the two programs will have different outputs for certain directed graphs. 

The first program implements a topological ordering algorithm using a depth-first search approach, while the second program is implementing the same concept using a breadth-first search approach. The two approaches can handle directed graphs with different properties in different ways. 

For example, consider a directed graph with 4 nodes: 1, 2, 3 and 4, where there is a directed edge from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 1 to 4. In the first program, node 4 will be ordered before node 3, while in the second program, node 3 will be ordered before node 4. This is because the first program uses DFS, which explores one branch until it reaches a leaf before backtracking, while the second program uses BFS, which explores all neighboring nodes before moving on to their neighbors. 

In general, DFS tends to favor exploring deep, narrow paths first, while BFS tends to favor exploring many shallow, wide paths. This can cause differences in the ordering of nodes in certain cases.
