No, the two programs should produce the same output for any input since both programs implement the Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected weighted graph. The only difference is that the first program uses a Map structure to group the nodes and a List<WeightedEdge> to store the edges of the minimum spanning tree, while the second program uses a PriorityQueue<WeightedEdge> to sort the edges and a Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> to group the nodes. However, these differences should not affect the correctness of the algorithm or the output.
