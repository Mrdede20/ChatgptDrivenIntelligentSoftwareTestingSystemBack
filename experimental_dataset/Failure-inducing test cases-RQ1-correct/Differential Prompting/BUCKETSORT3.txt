Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different outputs. The first program uses counting sort, where each element forms a "bucket" and the elements are sorted based on the number of elements in each bucket. The second program uses a different implementation of bucket sort, where the elements are distributed into pre-defined buckets and then sorted within each bucket.

Here is an example input that would produce different outputs:

```
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 1, 7, 9, 8, 2, 4, 6, 0));
int k = 10;
```

In the first program, this input would produce the output:

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In the second program, this input would produce the output:

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

As you can see, both programs produce the same output for this particular input. However, there are other inputs that could produce different outputs for the two programs.
