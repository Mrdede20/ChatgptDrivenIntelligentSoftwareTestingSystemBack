It's hard to answer that question without the full context of the code, specifically the implementation of the `Node` class and its methods. Assuming that they are similar and have the same functionality, there shouldn't be any input that will make the two programs have different outputs. They both use a breadth-first search algorithm to traverse a graph and find whether there is a path from `startNode` to `goalNode`.
