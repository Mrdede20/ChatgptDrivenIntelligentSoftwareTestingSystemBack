Yes, the two programs will have different output for very large inputs. The first program has a list comprehension method which checks if a number is divisible by all the prime numbers till that point. While the second program uses the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the primes upto the given input. The list comprehension method might not be efficient for large inputs as it checks divisibility for all primes smaller than n. While the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is much more efficient for finding all primes till a given number.
