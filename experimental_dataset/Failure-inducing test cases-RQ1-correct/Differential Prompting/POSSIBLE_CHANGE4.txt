Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. 

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3] and the total is 4, then the first program will return 4 (possible coin combinations: [1,1,1,1], [1,1,2], [2,2], [1,3]), while the second program will return 2 (possible coin combinations: [1,1,1,1], [2,2]). 

This is because in the first program, the recursive call for the coin with denomination 1 is made before the recursive call for the coin with denomination 2, while in the second program it is the opposite. Order matters in the recursive tree that is built, and thus the output can be different depending on the order of the recursive calls.
