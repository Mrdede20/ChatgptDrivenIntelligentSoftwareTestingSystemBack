The only difference between the two programs is the type of the ArrayList (raw type in the first program, generic type in the second program).
However, there is a potential bug in the first program due to using raw type which might lead to ClassCastException at runtime. 
Consider the case when the tokens ArrayList is constructed to contain both Doubles and Strings. The second program will throw a compilation error because the ArrayList is explicitly typed to hold only Strings. The first program will compile, but will throw a ClassCastException at runtime when trying to cast a String to a Double in the line `Double a = (Double) stack.pop()`. Therefore, the output of the two programs may differ if a runtime exception occurs in the first program. 
To test this, you can construct an ArrayList with both Doubles and Strings and pass it to both programs to see if the output differs in the first program due to a potential ClassCastException.
