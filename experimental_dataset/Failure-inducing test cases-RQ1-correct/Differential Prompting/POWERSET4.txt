The two programs have different package declarations and different class names, but assuming that the intent is to compare the functionality of the two methods, the answer is no, there is no input that will make them produce different output. Both programs implement the same algorithm for generating the power set of a set represented as a list, and will produce the same set of subsets for any non-empty input.
