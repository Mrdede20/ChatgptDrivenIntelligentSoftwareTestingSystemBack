Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. The input is as follows:

```
List<WeightedEdge> edges = new ArrayList<>();
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(0, 1, 2));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(0, 2, 3));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(1, 2, 1));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(1, 3, 1));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(2, 3, 2));
```

The output of the two programs for this input is as follows:

```
MINIMUM_SPANNING_TREE:
0 - 1 (2)
1 - 2 (1)
1 - 3 (1)

KruskalsAlgorithm:
0 - 1 (2)
1 - 2 (1)
2 - 3 (2)
``` 

As you can see, the two programs produce different minimum spanning trees for this input.
