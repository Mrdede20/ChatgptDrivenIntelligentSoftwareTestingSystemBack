Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. The difference between the two programs is that the first program uses a raw type for the Stack while the second program uses a generic type Stack<Double>. This means that the first program allows any type of object to be pushed onto the stack, while the second program only allows Double objects to be pushed. Therefore, if the input ArrayList contains non-Double objects, the two programs will produce different results.

For example, consider the input ArrayList {"1", "2", "3", "4", "+"}. The first program will evaluate this expression as 10.0, while the second program will correctly produce an error since the operator "+" cannot be applied to the non-Double objects "3" and "4".
