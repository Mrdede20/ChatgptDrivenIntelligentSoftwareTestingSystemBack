Yes, it is possible to have different outputs for the two programs for certain inputs. Here's a test case that would produce different outputs:

Input: [1, 3, 4, 2, 1]

The first program will return [2, 1, 1, 3, 4], while the second program will return [2, 1, 4, 1, 3].

Note that these programs implement different algorithms for generating the next permutation of a given list/array of numbers. The first program uses nested loops to find the next lexicographically larger permutation, while the second program uses a simpler and more efficient algorithm involving fewer steps. Therefore, the outputs will differ for some inputs.
