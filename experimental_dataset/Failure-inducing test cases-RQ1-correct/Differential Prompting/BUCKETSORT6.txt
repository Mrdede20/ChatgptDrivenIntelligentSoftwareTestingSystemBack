Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. The reason is that these two programs sort the array using different bucket sort algorithms.
For example, try the following input:

```
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(4, 15, 12, 3, 9));
int k = 3;
```

BUCKETSORT implementation will sort the array in the following way:

```
[3, 4, 9, 12, 15]
```

BucketSort implementation will sort the array in the following way:

```
[3, 4, 9, 12, 15]
```

But the two algorithms will produce different results for an input that contains negative numbers. Try the following input:

```
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(4, -15, 12, -3, 9));
int k = 3;
```

BUCKETSORT implementation will sort the array in the following way:

```
[-15, -3, 4, 9, 12]
```

BucketSort implementation will sort the array in the following way:

```
[-15, -3, 4, 9, 12]
```
