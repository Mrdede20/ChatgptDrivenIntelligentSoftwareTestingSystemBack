It is possible to have different output for the two programs. The first implementation uses raw type `ArrayList` which is not type safe, while the second implementation uses generic `List<Integer>`. The input that could make the two programs have different output is when the input list contains elements of a type that is not an `Integer`.

For example, consider the input list `[1, "hello"]`. The first implementation will throw a `ClassCastException` when trying to add `"hello"` to the `ArrayList r`. On the other hand, the second implementation will not even compile and will throw a compilation error due to the mismatch of types between the input list and the generic type `List<Integer>`. Therefore, it is important to make sure that the input list and the types used in the implementation match.
