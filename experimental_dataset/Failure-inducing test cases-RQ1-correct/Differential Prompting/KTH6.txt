The two programs are supposed to have the same functionality. The first program uses recursion to find the `k`th smallest element in an unsorted list of integers while the second one uses an iterative approach to do the same thing. There shouldn't be any input that gives a different output for the two programs if they are correct.

However, there is an issue with the second program where the `public` modifier is missing from the method signature. It should be:

```
public static int kth(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
    ...
}
```

Without the `public` modifier, the program will not compile.
