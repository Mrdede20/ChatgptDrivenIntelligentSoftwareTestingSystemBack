Yes, there is at least one input that makes the two programs output different results. 

The first program is using a map that groups the nodes by their connected components (groupByNode), while the second program is using a map that groups the nodes by their subsets (subsets).

If you pass the input below to both programs, you will get different results:

List<WeightedEdge> edges = new ArrayList<>();
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(0, 1, 2));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(0, 2, 3));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(1, 2, 1));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(1, 3, 1));
edges.add(new WeightedEdge(2, 3, 2));

The output of the first program will be:

[(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1)]

While the output of the second program will be:

[(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (0, 1, 2)]
