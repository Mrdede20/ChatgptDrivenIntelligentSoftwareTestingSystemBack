Yes, there could be input that makes these two programs have different output.

The difference between these two programs is in the initialization of the `memo` array. In the first program, the `memo` array is initialized with all zeros, while in the second program, only `memo[0][0]` is initialized to zero.

If the input has a capacity of zero and there is at least one item, the first program will return zero, while the second program will return the maximum value of the first item. This is because the first program sets `memo[0][0]` to zero and all other entries to uninitialized values (which happen to be zero), while the second program sets only `memo[0][0]` to zero and all other entries to uninitialized values (which could be any value).

Here's an example input that could illustrate the difference:

```
capacity = 0
items = {{1, 6}, {2, 10}}
```

The first program will return 0, while the second program will return 6.
