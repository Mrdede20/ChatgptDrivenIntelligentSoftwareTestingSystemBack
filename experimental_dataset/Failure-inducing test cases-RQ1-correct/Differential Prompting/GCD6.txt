The two programs will produce the same output for all inputs. 

Here's the test case you requested:

```
package correct_java_programs;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 12345;
        int b = 67890;
        System.out.println("GCD of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + GCD.gcd(a, b));
    }
}
```

Both versions of the `GCD` class will return the same result of `15`.
