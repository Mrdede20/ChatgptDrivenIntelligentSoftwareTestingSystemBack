Yes, there could be an input for which the two programs have different outputs. The first program implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, while the second program implements Dijkstra's algorithm for the same purpose.

The difference between the two algorithms is that Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative edge weights, while Dijkstra's algorithm cannot. Therefore, if there exists a negative edge weight in the input graph, the two programs may produce different output values.

Here is an example input where the two algorithms give different results:

```
Map<List<String>, Integer> weight_by_edge = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("A", "B"), 1);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("A", "C"), -1);
String source = "A";
```

For this input, the shortest path from node A to node C is "-1" according to the Bellman-Ford algorithm (since there exists a negative weighted edge from A to C), while Dijkstra's algorithm produces a result of "0" (since it cannot handle negative edges).
