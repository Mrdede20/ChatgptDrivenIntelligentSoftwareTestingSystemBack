Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs output different results. For example, if we use the input `int[] coins = {1, 2}; int total = 3;`, `POSSIBLE_CHANGE.possible_change(coins, total)` will return 2 while `CoinChange.possible_change(coins, total)` will return 1. The difference is due to the order in which the recursive calls are made. In the first program, the `possible_change` method first subtracts the first coin from the total, and then makes a recursive call with the same coin array, while in the second program, the method makes the recursive call first with the rest of the coins, and then subtracts the first coin from the total. This leads to different numbers of possible solutions being counted.
