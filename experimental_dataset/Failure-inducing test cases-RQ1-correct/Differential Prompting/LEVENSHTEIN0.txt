Yes, the two programs provide different implementations to calculate Levenshtein distance between two strings. The first program uses recursive approach, while the second program uses dynamic programming (tabulation) approach. Since the second approach is optimized and faster than the first one, it will take less time to execute and would be a more efficient approach. However, depending on the input string sizes, both approaches may differ in the output.
