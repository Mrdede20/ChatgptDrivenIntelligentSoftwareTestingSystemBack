Yes, these two programs could have different output for certain inputs because they have different implementations of the shortest path algorithm. The first program uses a simple form of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths from a single node to all other nodes in the graph, while the second program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single node to all other nodes in the graph. 

To create an input that produces different results, we could construct a graph with negative weight edges. The first program would produce the correct output since it uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm which can handle negative weight edges, but the second program would produce incorrect output as it doesn't handle negative weight edges. 

Here's an example input that would produce different output:

```
Map<List<String>, Integer> weight_by_edge = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("A", "B"), 1);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("A", "C"), 4);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("B", "C"), 3);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("B", "D"), 2);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("B", "E"), -3); // negative weight edge
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("D", "C"), 5);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("D", "B"), 1);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("E", "D"), 1);

int source = 0;

// Run the two implementations
Map<String, Integer> shortestPaths1 = SHORTEST_PATHS.shortest_paths("A", weight_by_edge);
Map<Integer, Integer> shortestPaths2 = new DijkstraAlgorithm().shortest_paths(source, createWeightByNode(weight_by_edge));
``` 

The output of the first program would correctly show that the shortest path from A to E is -1, while the output of the second program would show that the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 (representing E) is 0, since it doesn't handle negative weight edges correctly.
