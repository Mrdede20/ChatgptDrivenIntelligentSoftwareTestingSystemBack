Yes, there could be different output for different inputs. Despite the algorithms being similar, they have slight differences in implementation that can affect how they traverse the graph. One difference that could directly affect the output is the order in which the nodes are added to the queue. The first implementation uses `queue.addLast(successor_node)` while the second implementation uses `queue.offer(neighbor)`. This means that the first implementation adds the nodes to the end of the queue while the latter adds them to the tail. These differences in queue implementation can result in a different order in which nodes are traversed, leading to different output.
