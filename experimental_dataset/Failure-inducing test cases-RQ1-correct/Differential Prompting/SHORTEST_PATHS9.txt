Yes, the two programs can have different outputs for some inputs, because they are solving the same problem (finding shortest paths in a graph), but they are using different algorithms to do so. The first program is using a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, while the second program is using Dijkstra's algorithm. These algorithms may produce different results for the same input graph with different edge weights.

To illustrate this, consider the following example graph with three nodes and three edges:

```
     2
(0)------>(1)
 |      1
 |      |
 |      |
 |      |3
 v      v
(2)<------(3)
     1
```

If we run the `shortest_paths` method of `SHORTEST_PATHS` with the source node 0 and the following weight_by_edge map:

```
{(0, 1): 2, (1, 3): 3, (3, 2): 1, (2, 0): 1}
```

we get the result:

```
{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 5}
```

On the other hand, if we run the `shortest_paths` method of `DijkstraAlgorithm` with source node 0 and the following weight_by_edge map:

```
{0: {1: 2}, 1: {3: 3}, 3: {2: 1}, 2: {0: 1}}
```

we get the result:

```
{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 5}
```

As we can see, the two algorithms produce different results for this input graph. The reason for this is that the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative edge weights, while Dijkstra's algorithm cannot. In this example, there are no negative edge weights, so both algorithms should work correctly, but with different results.
