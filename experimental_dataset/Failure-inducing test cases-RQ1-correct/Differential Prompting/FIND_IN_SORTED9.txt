Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. The difference stems from how each program handles the inclusive/exclusive nature of the array bounds. The first program uses an exclusive end bound (i.e., the element at the index "end" is not included in the search), whereas the second program uses an inclusive end bound (i.e., the element at the index "right" is included in the search). Therefore, if the input array contains the value of x at its last index, the first program will not find it, whereas the second program will. 

Here's a test case that demonstrates the difference: 

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int x = 5;
int index1 = FIND_IN_SORTED.find_in_sorted(arr, x); // returns -1
int index2 = find_in_sorted_inclusive(arr, x); // returns 4

// Second program with inclusive end bound
public static int find_in_sorted_inclusive(int[] arr, int x) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length;

    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == x) {
            return mid;
        } else if (x < arr[mid]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
``` 

Note that the second program has been modified to use an inclusive end bound to demonstrate the difference.
