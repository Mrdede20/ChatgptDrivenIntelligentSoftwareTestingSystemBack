No, the two programs above have the same functionality and output given the same input. The first program uses a recursive implementation of binary search while the second uses an iterative implementation, but the logic and algorithm used is the same. Both functions return the index of the element `x` in the input array `arr` if it is found, and `-1` if it is not found. The only difference is that the first program checks if the input array is empty in the `find_in_sorted` function while the second program checks this condition in the `binsearch` function.
