There seems to be some mistake in the second code block. The method definition is missing the class definition. However, assuming that the second block is a part of the same class as the first one and the method is properly encapsulated in the class, the two programs have different approaches to finding the kth smallest element in the array. 

The first program uses the quickselect algorithm with explicit recursion, i.e., it recursively partitions the array into below-pivot, above-pivot, and pivot elements until it finds the kth smallest element. The second program uses the quickselect algorithm with an iterative approach, i.e., it partitions the array into below-pivot and above-pivot elements iteratively until it finds the kth smallest element.

It is possible that the two approaches result in different orderings of the elements in the array, especially if there are duplicates. Therefore, it is possible that the two programs might have different outputs for some inputs. However, for most inputs, the two programs should have the same output.
