Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output. The reason is that they use different algorithms to find the first occurrence of an element in a sorted array. 

The first program uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of the element, while the second program finds the first occurrence of the element using a slightly modified binary search algorithm. 

An input that can make the two programs have different output is an array containing duplicates of the search element but with different orderings. 

For example, consider the input array `arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}` and the search element `x = 2`. 

The first program would return index `1` as the first occurrence of `2`, whereas the second program would return index `2`. Therefore, the output of the two programs would be different for this input.
