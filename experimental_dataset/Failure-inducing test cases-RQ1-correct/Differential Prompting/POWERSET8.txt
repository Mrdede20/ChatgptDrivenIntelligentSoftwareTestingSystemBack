There is a syntactical error in the second program which will cause it to not compile. The import statements should specify `java` before `util`. The correct import statements for the second program should look like:

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
```

Other than that, the input/output behavior of the two programs should be the same.
