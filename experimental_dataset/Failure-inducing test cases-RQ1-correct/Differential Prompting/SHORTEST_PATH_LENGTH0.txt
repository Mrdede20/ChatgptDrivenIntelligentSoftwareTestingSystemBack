Yes, these two programs have different input formats and logic to find the shortest path length. The first program takes a graph as input, where edges are represented by a map with lists of nodes and their corresponding lengths. On the other hand, the second program takes a graph as input, where edges are represented by a map with keys as nodes and values again as a map with neighboring nodes and their corresponding lengths.
