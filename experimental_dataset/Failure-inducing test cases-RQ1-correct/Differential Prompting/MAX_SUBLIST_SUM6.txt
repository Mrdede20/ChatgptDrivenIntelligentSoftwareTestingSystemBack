Yes, there are inputs that can make these two programs have different output. Specifically, the second program initializes `max_so_far` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` instead of `0`. This means that the second program can handle cases where all elements in the input array are negative. For example, if `arr` is `[-2, -3, -4, -1, -2, -1, -5, -3]`, the first program will return `0` while the second program will return `-1`.
