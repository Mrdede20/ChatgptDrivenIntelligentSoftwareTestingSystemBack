Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here is an example and the explanation:

Consider numNodes to be 3, and the following length_by_edge:
```
{{0,1},1}
{{1,0},2}
{{1,2},1}
{{2,0},4}
{{2,1},1}
```

For this input, the `SHORTEST_PATH_LENGTHS` class will return the following shortest path lengths:
```
{{0,0},0}
{{0,1},1}
{{0,2},2}
{{1,0},2}
{{1,1},0}
{{1,2},1}
{{2,0},3}
{{2,1},1}
{{2,2},0}
```

On the other hand, the `ShortestPath` class will return the following shortest path lengths:
```
{{1,1},0}
{{1,2},1}
{{1,3},2}
{{2,1},2}
{{2,2},0}
{{2,3},1}
{{3,1},4}
{{3,2},3}
{{3,3},0}
```

As we can see, the two programs return different shortest path lengths. The reason is that the two programs use different indexing schemes for the nodes. In the `SHORTEST_PATH_LENGTHS` class, the nodes are indexed from 0 to numNodes-1, while in the `ShortestPath` class, the nodes are indexed from 1 to numNodes. So, the nodes in the input need to be adjusted accordingly to get the same output from both programs.
