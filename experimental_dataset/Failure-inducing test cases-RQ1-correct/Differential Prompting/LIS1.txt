Yes, there exist inputs which can make the two programs return different outputs. Here is an example input:

```
int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4};
```

The first program returns 4, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence, {1, 3, 4, 5}. The second program also returns 4 for this input. 

However, if we change the input array to:

```
int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5};
```

then the first program returns 4, which is the length of the LIS, {1, 3, 4, 5}, while the second program returns 3, which is the length of the LIS, {1, 3, 4}.
