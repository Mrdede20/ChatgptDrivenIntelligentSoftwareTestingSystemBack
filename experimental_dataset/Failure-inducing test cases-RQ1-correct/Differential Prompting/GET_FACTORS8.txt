No, both programs have the same logic and will output the same result for any given input. The difference lies in how the factors are added to the ArrayList - in the first program, each factor is added to a new ArrayList and then all ArrayLists are concatenated using the addAll() method, while in the second program, the ArrayList is built up by adding factors to it directly using the add() method.
