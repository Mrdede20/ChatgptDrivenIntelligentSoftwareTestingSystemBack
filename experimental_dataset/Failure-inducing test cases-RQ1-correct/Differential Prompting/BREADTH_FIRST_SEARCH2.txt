There might be an input that makes the two programs have different output because:

1. The first program uses Deque (double-ended queue) and adds a node to the last position with addLast() while the second program uses a Queue (interface) and adds a node to the last position using offer() method. If the order of adding elements matters in some special case, they could produce different results.

2. Both programs use a Set to keep track of visited nodes. However, the first program uses a static Set while the second program declares a separate Set within the method. This means the buggy program might mishandle the nodesvisited set if it's used in multiple instances concurrently.

To test this, you can try running both programs with a graph that has a cycle. The first program might end up looping forever while the second program should terminate upon visiting all nodes.
