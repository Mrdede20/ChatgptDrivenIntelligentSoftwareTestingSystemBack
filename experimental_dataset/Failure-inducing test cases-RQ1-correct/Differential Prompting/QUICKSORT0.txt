Yes, the two programs can have a different output for certain inputs. The first program chooses the first element of the input array as the pivot while the second program chooses the last element of the input array as the pivot. Thus, for certain inputs where the first and last elements are not the same, the two programs will generate different output. For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 4, 2, 5], the first program will choose 3 as the pivot, while the second program will choose 5 as the pivot. The resulting sorted arrays will be different.
