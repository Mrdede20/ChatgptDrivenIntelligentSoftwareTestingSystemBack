These two programs are solving the same problem, which is to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. However, the implementation of the algorithms are different. The first program is using a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, while the second program is using Dijkstra's algorithm.

There can be cases where the two algorithms may produce different results because they have different approaches to determining the shortest path. In particular, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative weight edges in a graph, while Dijkstra's algorithm cannot. Therefore, if the input graph has negative weight edges, the two algorithms may produce different results.

Here is an example of an input that can produce different output for the two programs:

```
Map<List<String>,Integer> weight_by_edge = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("A", "B"), 2);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("B", "C"), 1);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("C", "D"), -3);
weight_by_edge.put(Arrays.asList("D", "A"), 1);
Map<String,Integer> sp1 = SHORTEST_PATHS.shortest_paths("A", weight_by_edge);
Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> weight_by_edge2 = new HashMap<>();
Map<Integer, Integer> weight_by_edge2_A = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge2_A.put(1, 2);
Map<Integer, Integer> weight_by_edge2_B = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge2_B.put(2, 1);
Map<Integer, Integer> weight_by_edge2_C = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge2_C.put(3, -3);
Map<Integer, Integer> weight_by_edge2_D = new HashMap<>();
weight_by_edge2_D.put(4, 1);
weight_by_edge2.put(1, weight_by_edge2_A);
weight_by_edge2.put(2, weight_by_edge2_B);
weight_by_edge2.put(3, weight_by_edge2_C);
weight_by_edge2.put(4, weight_by_edge2_D);
Map<Integer, Integer> sp2 = new DijkstraAlgorithm().shortest_paths(1, weight_by_edge2);
System.out.println(sp1); // Output will be {A=0, B=2, C=3, D=0}
System.out.println(sp2); // Output will be {1=0, 2=2, 3=5, 4=1}
```

Note that the edge from C to D has negative weight, and the graph has been constructed in a way that node D can be reached from the source node A with a negative weight cycle.
