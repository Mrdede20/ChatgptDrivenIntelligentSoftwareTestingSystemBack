Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different outputs. To illustrate this, consider the following input with 4 vertices and 4 edges:

    0 - 1 (1)
    0 - 2 (2)
    1 - 3 (1)
    2 - 3 (3)

The expected minimum spanning tree has two edges: 0-1 (weight: 1) and 1-3 (weight: 1).

The first program (MINIMUM_SPANNING_TREE) produces the expected output, while the second program (KruskalsAlgorithm) produces a different minimum spanning tree that has two edges: 0-1 (weight: 1) and 0-2 (weight: 2).
