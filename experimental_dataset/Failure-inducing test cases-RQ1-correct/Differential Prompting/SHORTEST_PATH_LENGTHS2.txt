Yes, the two programs can have different output if the input graph has self-loops. In the first program, the condition `if (i == j)` sets the length of the self-loop to zero. However, the second program does not handle self-loops in that way, so it might have a different output.

Here's an example input that would cause the two programs to have different output:

```
numNodes = 3
length_by_edge = {
    [1, 2]: 1,
    [2, 3]: 2,
    [3, 1]: 3,
    [1, 1]: 5
}
```

In this case, the self-loop for node 1 has length 5 in the first program, but would have length INF (since `length_by_path.get(node2)` would be INF) in the second program.
