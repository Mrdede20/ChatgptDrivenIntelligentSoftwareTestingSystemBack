The first program is missing the `private` modifier before the method `kth`, which means it can be accessed from outside the class, while the second program has the correct modifier. Therefore, if another class calls `kth` from the first program, it will not work correctly because the `partition` method is not accessible. This can create differences in output between the two programs.
