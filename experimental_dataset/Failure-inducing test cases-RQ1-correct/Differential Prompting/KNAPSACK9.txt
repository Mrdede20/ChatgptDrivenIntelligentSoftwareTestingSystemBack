Yes, there are input cases that can make these two programs output different results. 

The main difference between these two programs is the initialization of the `memo` array. In the first program, the `memo` array is initialized with 0's for all elements, including the first row and column. In the second program, the `memo` array is initialized with 0's for all elements except the first row and column.

Therefore, if the input items array contains an item with weight 0, the two programs will give different results. The first program will correctly handle the item with weight 0 and output the correct result, while the second program will skip this item and potentially output an incorrect result.

Here's an example input that will demonstrate the difference:

```java
int[][] items = {{0, 10}, {3, 20}};
int capacity = 3;

System.out.println(KNAPSACK.knapsack(capacity, items)); // returns 30
System.out.println(knapsack(capacity, items)); // returns 20
```

In this example, the first item has weight 0 and value 10, and the second item has weight 3 and value 20. The knapsack capacity is 3. The first program will correctly include the first item with weight 0 and output a result of 30, while the second program will skip the first item and output a result of 20.
