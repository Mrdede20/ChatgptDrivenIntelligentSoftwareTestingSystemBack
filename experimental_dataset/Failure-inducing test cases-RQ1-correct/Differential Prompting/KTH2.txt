There seem to be a mistake in the second program. The second program does not compile as it is missing the class declaration. 

However, assuming that the second program is also a Java implementation of finding the kth smallest element in an unsorted array, there can be cases where the two implementations can produce different outputs. This is because both algorithms use different strategies to find the kth element, which can lead to different results, especially when the array contains repeated elements.

For example, consider the input array [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1] and k = 4. The first implementation would find the pivot as 2, and since there are only two elements less than 2, it would recurse on the right sub-array with k' = k - 2 = 2. The right sub-array is [3, 4], and the pivot of this sub-array is 3, which is the kth element.

The second implementation, using the quickselect algorithm, would first choose 1 as the pivot, and move all elements less than 1 to the left, and all elements greater than 1 to the right. The array would become [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]. Since the pivot index is 0, which is less than k - 1 = 3, it would recurse on the right sub-array with k' = 4 - 1 - 0 = 3. The right sub-array is [2, 2, 2, 3, 4], and the pivot of this sub-array is 3, which is also the kth element.

Therefore, in this case, both implementations produce the same output. However, in cases where the array contains repeated elements and k is close to the number of distinct elements, the two implementations can produce different outputs.
