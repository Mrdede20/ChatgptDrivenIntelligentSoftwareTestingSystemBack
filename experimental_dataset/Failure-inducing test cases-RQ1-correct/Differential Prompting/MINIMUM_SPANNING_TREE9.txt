Yes, there is an input that may cause the output to be different. The first program uses `Node` object to represent vertices of a graph, while the second program uses integers to represent vertices. If the order in which the vertices are added to the `List<WeightedEdge> edges` is different, the two programs may produce different minimum spanning trees. For example, if we add `new WeightedEdge(1, 3, 1)` before `new WeightedEdge(0, 2, 3)` to the list, then the two programs would produce different minimum spanning trees.
