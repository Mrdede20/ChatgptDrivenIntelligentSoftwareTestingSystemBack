Yes, it is possible for the two programs to have different output for certain inputs. Here is a test case that produces different output:

```java
String a = "ABCDEF";
String b = "GHIDEF";
```

The first program will return "DEF", which is the longest common subsequence between a and b. However, the second program will return "EF", which is also a common subsequence, but not the longest. 

This happens because the two programs use different approaches to compute the longest common subsequence. The first program recursively compares the first characters of the strings and either includes or excludes them, while the second program uses a dynamic programming approach based on the length of the strings. Therefore, they may produce different results for some inputs.
