No, the two programs will give the same output for every input. Both programs implement binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The only difference is in the way the middle index is computed in the first program (using integer division) and the way the left and right boundaries are updated in the second program (using arithmetic operations). However, these differences do not affect the correctness of the algorithm or the output produced by the program.
