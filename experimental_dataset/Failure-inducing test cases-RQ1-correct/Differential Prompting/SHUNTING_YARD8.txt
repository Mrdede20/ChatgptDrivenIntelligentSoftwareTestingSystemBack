The two programs have different imports. The first program imports from `java.util.*`, which imports all the classes in the package, while the second program has specific imports from `java.util.Stack` and `java.util.ArrayList`. This difference in importing may result in different behaviors of the code, but as the core functionality of both programs is the same, the output should not be different for valid inputs.
