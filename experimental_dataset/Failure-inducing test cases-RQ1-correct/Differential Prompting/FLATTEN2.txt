Yes, there is an input which can produce different output for the two programs. The reason is that the first program is using the standard ArrayList class from the java.util package, while the second program is using a custom ArrayList class. Depending on how the custom ArrayList class is implemented, it could behave differently than the standard ArrayList class, which would result in different output for the two programs.

Here's an example test case that could produce different output:
```
Object input = new Object[] {1, 2, new Object[] {3, 4, new Object[] {5, 6}}, 7};
Object output1 = FLATTEN.flatten(input);
Object output2 = FlattenObjectArray.flatten(input);
```
In this test case, the input is a nested array that contains integers and arrays. The FLATTEN.flatten method and the FlattenObjectArray.flatten method both recursively flatten the input array and return a single ArrayList of integers. However, depending on how the custom ArrayList class is implemented, it could produce different output than the standard ArrayList class used in the first program.
