Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs give different output. 

Here is a test case that shows the difference: 

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3};
int x = 2;
```

The first program will return 1, which is the index of the first occurrence of 2 in the array. 

The second program will return 1 as well, which is the index of the first occurrence of 2 in the array. 

However, if we change the input slightly to: 

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3};
int x = 4;
```

The first program will return -1, indicating that the number 4 is not found in the array.

The second program will also return -1 in this case.
