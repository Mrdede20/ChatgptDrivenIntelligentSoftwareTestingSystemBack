The two programs have different imports, and thus they have different implementations of ArrayList and Stack classes. This means that they may behave differently for the same input data. Therefore, it is possible that they may have different outputs for some inputs. However, it is not clear from the code provided if there is a specific input for which the programs produce different outputs.
