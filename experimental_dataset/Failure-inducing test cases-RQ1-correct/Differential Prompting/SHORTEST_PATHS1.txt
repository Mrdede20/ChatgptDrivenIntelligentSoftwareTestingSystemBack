Yes, there could be test cases where the two programs have different outputs.

The first program `SHORTEST_PATHS` calculates the shortest distances between nodes in an undirected weighted graph represented by `weight_by_edge` map. It uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path between the source node and every other node in the graph.

The second program `DijkstraAlgorithm` calculates the shortest distances between nodes in an undirected weighted graph represented by `weight_by_edge` map. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the source node and every other node in the graph.

The two programs use different algorithms to find the shortest distances, which means they may produce different outputs for certain inputs.

Here's an example input that could result in different outputs:

```
Source node: A

Edges:
(A, B): 1
(A, C): 2
(B, D): 3
(C, D): 1
```

Using this input, the `SHORTEST_PATHS` program should produce the following output:

```
{A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3}
```

while the `DijkstraAlgorithm` program should produce the following output:

```
{A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3}
```

In this case, the two programs produce the same output, but there could be other inputs where they produce different outputs.
