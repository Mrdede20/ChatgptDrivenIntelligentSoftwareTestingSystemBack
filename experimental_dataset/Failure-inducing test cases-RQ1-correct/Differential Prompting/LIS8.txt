Yes, there can be an input which makes the two programs output different results. Here is one such test case:

```
int[] arr = {5, 0, 9, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 6};
```

The `LIS` program above would return 6, which is the correct answer. However, the `LongestIncreasingSubsequence` program would return 5 instead.
