Yes, the two programs may have different outputs for certain inputs. The reason is that the first program uses the built-in `java.util.ArrayList` while the second program uses a custom implementation of `ArrayList`. This custom implementation may have some differences or limitations compared to the built-in one, which may result in a different output for certain inputs that involve a complex nested array structure. 

Here is an example input that may produce different outputs for the two programs:

```
// Input:
Object arr = new Object[] {1, 2, new Object[] {3, 4, new Object[] {5, 6}}, 7};

// Output for the first program:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

// Output for the second program:
[1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7]
```

As you can see, the two outputs are different even though they represent the same flattened array structure. The first program uses the built-in `ArrayList` to flatten the nested arrays, which produces a single flat list. The second program uses a custom implementation of `ArrayList` that preserves the original nested structure of the input, by adding each nested array as a separate element of the flattened array.
