Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs return different output. The first program uses a `Map<String, Integer>` to store the operator precedence, while the second program has a separate `hasPrecedence` function to check the precedence of operators. The difference in implementation of operator precedence between the two programs may cause them to return different output for certain inputs. 

Here's an example input that may cause the two programs to return different output: 

```
Input: ["2", "*", "3", "+", "4", "*", "1"]
```

The expected output for this input is: 

```
[2, 3, *, 4, 1, *, +]
```

However, due to the difference in operator precedence implementation, the two programs may return different outputs for this input.
