Yes, the two programs will have different output for some inputs. 

The method `possible_change` in the class `POSSIBLE_CHANGE` recursively calls itself with the original array `coins` each time, while the method `possible_change` in the class `CoinChange` makes a recursive call with the remaining coins after `first` coin is chosen. 

This means that the order of the `total` and `coins` parameters that are passed to the recursive calls will be different in the two programs, potentially leading to different results for certain inputs. 

For example, if we change the input array to `{5, 2, 1}` and `total` to `10`, the two programs will output different answers. `POSSIBLE_CHANGE` will return 4 and `CoinChange` will return 3.
