The two programs use different package imports: `java.util.ArrayList` in the second program and `import .util.ArrayList;` in the first program. This means that they are using different ArrayList classes, which could behave differently in certain cases. 

For example, if there is a custom ArrayList class defined in the same package as the first program, and this custom class has some implementation differences from the standard `java.util.ArrayList` class, then the output of the two programs could be different when passed the same input. 

However, assuming that both programs are using the standard `java.util.ArrayList` class, they should output the same result when given the same input.
