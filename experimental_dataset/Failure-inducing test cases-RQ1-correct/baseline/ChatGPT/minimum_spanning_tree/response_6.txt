Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program such as:

1. Empty input list: If the input list weight_by_edge is empty, then the program will throw an IndexError when attempting to sort it. This can be triggered by calling the function with an empty list as follows:
   minimum_spanning_tree([])

2. Input with only one node: If the input list weight_by_edge contains only one node, the program will return an empty set as there is no edge to connect it. This can be triggered by calling the function with a list containing only one node as follows:
   minimum_spanning_tree([(1,1)])

3. Input with disconnected nodes: If the input list weight_by_edge contains nodes that are not connected to any other node, the program will return an empty set as there is no edge to connect them. This can be triggered by calling the function with a list containing disconnected nodes as follows:
   minimum_spanning_tree([(1,2),(5,6),(8,9)])

4. Input with cycles: If the input list weight_by_edge contains edges that form a cycle, the program will not be able to form a minimum spanning tree and will return incorrect results. This can be triggered by calling the function with a list containing edges that form a cycle as follows:
   minimum_spanning_tree([(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,4)])

5. Input with duplicate edges: If the input list weight_by_edge contains duplicate edges, the program may return incorrect results or throw an exception. Duplicate edges should be removed before calling the function. This can be triggered by calling the function with a list containing duplicate edges as follows:
   minimum_spanning_tree([(1,2),(2,3),(1,2),(4,5)])

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the above function:

# define a test case with some input data
weight_by_edge = {'A-B': 7, 'A-D': 5, 'B-C': 8, 'B-D': 9, 'B-E': 7, 'C-E': 5, 'D-E': 15, 'D-F': 6, 'E-F': 8, 'E-G': 9, 'F-G': 11}
expected_output = {('A', 'D'), ('A', 'B'), ('B', 'E'), ('C', 'E'), ('D', 'F'), ('E', 'G')}

# execute the function with the test data
result = minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge)

# check if the output matches the expected result
assert result == expected_output, f"Failed - Expected: {expected_output}, Actual: {result}"
