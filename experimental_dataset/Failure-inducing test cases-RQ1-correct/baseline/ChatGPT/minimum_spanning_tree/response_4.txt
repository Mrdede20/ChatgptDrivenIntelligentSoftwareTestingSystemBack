Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. If the input graph contains a cycle with negative weight, the program will not find the minimum spanning tree correctly. Instead of outputting the minimum spanning tree, the program might output a subset of the tree or even a non-tree set of edges.

For instance, consider the following input graph:

```
weight_by_edge = {
    (1, 2): 1,
    (2, 3): 2,
    (3, 1): -3,
    (3, 4): 4,
    (4, 5): 5,
    (5, 3): -6,
}
```

This graph has a negative-weight cycle involving nodes 1, 2, and 3. The correct minimum spanning tree would be the subset of edges {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)} with total weight 12. However, the program may output a different set of edges depending on the order in which it processes the input edges.

A test case that exposes this bug could be:

```
assert minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge) == {(3, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (2, 3)}
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
