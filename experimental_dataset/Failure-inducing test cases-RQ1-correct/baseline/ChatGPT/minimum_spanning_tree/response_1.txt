There is no specific test case mentioned in the code above, but a potential test case that could trigger a bug in the code is when the input weight_by_edge contains a cycle or a disconnected graph. This could cause the algorithm to get stuck in an infinite loop or not create a valid minimum spanning tree. Another potential test case could be when there are duplicate edges with the same weight, which could result in the algorithm adding both edges to the final minimum spanning tree, violating the definition of a minimum spanning tree.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
