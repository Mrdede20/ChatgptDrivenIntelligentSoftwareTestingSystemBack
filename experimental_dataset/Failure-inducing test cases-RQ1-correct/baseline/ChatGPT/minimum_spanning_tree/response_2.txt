Yes, there are test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. One possible test case is to pass in a weight_by_edge dictionary where all the edges have the same weight, such as {"AB": 1, "AC": 1, "BC": 1}. In this case, the program will add all the edges to the minimum spanning tree, even though it is not a minimum spanning tree as the three edges form a cycle. The correct output should only contain two edges, "AB" and "AC", which form a tree.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case:

weight_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 2, ('B', 'C'): 3, ('A', 'C'): 1, ('C', 'D'): 4}
actual_mst_edges = minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge)
expected_mst_edges = {('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('C', 'D')}

assert actual_mst_edges == expected_mst_edges

This test case asserts that the minimum spanning tree returned by the function given a weighted graph matches the expected minimum spanning tree.
