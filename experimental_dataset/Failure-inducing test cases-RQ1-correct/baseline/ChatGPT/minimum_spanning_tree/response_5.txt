Yes, there are several test cases that could trigger bugs in this program. Some possibilities include:

1. Passing in an empty weight_by_edge dictionary.
2. Passing in a weight_by_edge dictionary where all edges have the same weight.
3. Passing in a weight_by_edge dictionary where one or more nodes are not connected to any other nodes.
4. Passing in a weight_by_edge dictionary where there are multiple disjoint sets of nodes, and the minimum spanning tree should include edges that bridge the sets.

In general, it's important to test a variety of input cases to ensure that a program works correctly in all scenarios.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case to verify the correctness of the function:

def test_minimum_spanning_tree():
\    weight_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 4, ('A', 'H'): 8, ('B', 'C'): 8,
\                      ('B', 'H'): 11, ('C', 'D'): 7, ('C', 'F'): 4,
\                      ('C', 'I'): 2, ('D', 'E'): 9, ('D', 'F'): 14,
\                      ('E', 'F'): 10, ('F', 'G'): 2, ('G', 'H'): 1,
\                      ('G', 'I'): 6, ('H', 'I'): 7}
\    expected_mst_edges = {('A', 'B'), ('A', 'H'), ('C', 'I'), ('C', 'F'),
\                          ('D', 'C'), ('F', 'G'), ('H', 'G'), ('E', 'D')}
\
\    mst_edges = minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge)
\    assert mst_edges == expected_mst_edges, f"Expected {expected_mst_edges}, but got {mst_edges}"
