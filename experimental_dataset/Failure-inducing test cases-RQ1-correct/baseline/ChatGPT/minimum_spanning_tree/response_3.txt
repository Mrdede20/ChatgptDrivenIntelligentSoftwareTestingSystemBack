Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in this program:

1. If weight_by_edge is an empty dictionary, the program will throw an error when trying to sort it. 
2. If weight_by_edge contains a cycle, the program will enter an infinite loop trying to merge nodes. For example, if the dictionary contains the edges {(A, B): 1, (B, C): 1, (C, A): 1}, the program will keep merging nodes A, B, and C until it runs out of memory or exceeds some recursion limit (depending on the Python implementation). 
3. If there are multiple edges between the same pair of nodes with different weights, the program may choose the wrong edge to include in the MST. For example, if the dictionary contains the edges {(A, B): 1, (B, C): 2, (C, A): 3}, the program should choose edges A-B and B-C, but may mistakenly choose edge C-A instead. 
4. If there are disconnected components in the graph, the program will not find an MST that spans all nodes. For example, if the dictionary contains the edges {(A, B): 1, (C, D): 2}, the program will only return the edge A-B or C-D, but not both. 
5. There may be other edge cases or bugs depending on the input format and data types used.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the `minimum_spanning_tree` function:

```
def test_minimum_spanning_tree():
    # Create a weighted graph
    graph = {
        (1, 2): 1,
        (1, 3): 4,
        (2, 3): 2,
        (2, 4): 3,
        (3, 4): 5,
        (3, 5): 1,
        (4, 5): 6
    }

    # Calculate the minimum spanning tree
    mst = minimum_spanning_tree(graph)

    # Check that the result is correct
    assert mst == {(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)}
```

This test case creates a weighted graph and calculates the minimum spanning tree using the `minimum_spanning_tree` function. It then checks that the result is correct by comparing it to the expected output using the `assert` statement.
