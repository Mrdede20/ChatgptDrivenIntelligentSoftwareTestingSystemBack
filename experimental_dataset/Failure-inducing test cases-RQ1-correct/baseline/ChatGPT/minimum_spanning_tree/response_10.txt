Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger bugs in this program. Some of these cases include:

1. Input with multiple minimum spanning trees: If the input contains multiple minimum spanning trees, the program may not necessarily return the same minimum spanning tree for each run. This can happen if there exist multiple edges with the same weight that can be included in the minimum spanning tree. 
Example input: {'AB': 1, 'BC': 2, 'CD': 2, 'DE': 1, 'AE': 3}
Expected output: {('AB', 1), ('DE', 1), ('BC', 2), ('CD', 2)}
Actual output may vary.

2. Input with negative weight edges: The program does not handle negative edge weights, and as such may return incorrect output if such edges exist in the input. 
Example input: {'AB': 1, 'BC': 2, 'CD': -2, 'DE': 1, 'AE': 3} 
Expected output: {('AB', 1), ('DE', 1), ('BC', 2)}
Actual output may vary.

3. Input with self-loops: The program does not handle self-loops, and may result in incorrect output if such edges exist in the input. 
Example input: {'AB': 1, 'BC': 2, 'CD': 2, 'DE': 1, 'AA': 3}
Expected output: {('AB', 1), ('DE', 1), ('BC', 2), ('CD', 2)}
Actual output may vary.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert to verify the output of the minimum_spanning_tree function:

weight_by_edge = {(1,2): 5, 
                  (1,3): 3,
                  (2,3): 4,
                  (3,4): 9,
                  (1,4): 2}

mst = minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge)
assert mst == {(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)}

This test case verifies that the minimum spanning tree of the given graph (with weights defined by the weight_by_edge dictionary) is correctly calculated by the minimum_spanning_tree function. It uses assert to compare the expected result (the set of edges in the minimum spanning tree) to the actual result returned by the function. If the values match, the test passes, otherwise it will raise an AssertionError.
