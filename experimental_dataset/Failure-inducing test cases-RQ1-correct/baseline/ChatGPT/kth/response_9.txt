Yes, there are multiple test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program:

1. An empty array as input: If an empty array is passed as input to the function, the program will result in an index error as it tries to access the first element of the array. 

2. An array with all equal elements: If the array passed as input to the function contains all the same elements, the program will enter an infinite recursion loop as both below and above arrays will be empty. 

3. An array with duplicate elements: If the input array contains duplicate elements, the program may return the wrong kth element as it is only considering elements less than or greater than the pivot, and not accounting for duplicate elements. 

4. An index value greater than the length of the array: If a value of k greater than or equal to the length of the array is passed as input, the program will enter an infinite recursion loop as it continuously tries to find a value smaller than k. 

5. A negative index value: If a negative value of k is passed as input, the program may return the wrong kth element as it only considers elements above and below the pivot.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case for the above function:

def test_kth():
\    arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 4]
\    assert kth(arr, 0) == 1
\    assert kth(arr, 1) == 2
\    assert kth(arr, 2) == 4
\    assert kth(arr, 3) == 5
\    assert kth(arr, 4) == 7
\    assert kth(arr, 5) == 9

This test case checks if the function is able to correctly return the kth smallest element of an unsorted array, given the value of k. Each assertion checks for a specific k value and its expected result. If any of the assertions fail, it indicates that there is an error in the function and it needs to be fixed.
