Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger a bug in the program below:

1. Input array is empty: If the input array is empty, the program will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of the array.
2. Non-integer value of k: If the value of k is not an integer, the program will fail as the program assumes k as an index of an array.
3. Input array contains duplicate values: If the input array contains duplicate values, the program may return an incorrect result as it does not handle duplicate values in the array.
4. Input array is not sorted: If the input array is not sorted, the program may return an incorrect result as it assumes that the input array is sorted.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
