Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program:

1. If the input array contains duplicate elements, the program will not handle them properly and may return an incorrect result.

2. If the input array is empty, the program may raise an index out of range error.

3. If the value of k is greater than or equal to the length of the input array, the program may raise an index out of range error.

4. If the input array contains negative numbers, the program may not handle them properly and may return an incorrect result.

5. If the input array contains very large numbers, the program may run into memory or performance issues.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
