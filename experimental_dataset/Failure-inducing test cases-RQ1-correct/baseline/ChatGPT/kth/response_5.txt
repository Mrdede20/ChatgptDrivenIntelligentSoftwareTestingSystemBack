Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program.

1. If the input array is empty or contains only one element, the program will throw an error when trying to access `arr[0]`.
2. If the input array contains duplicate elements, the `num_less` and `num_lessoreq` calculations may be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.
3. If the input `k` is outside the range of valid indices (i.e. less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array), the program will enter an infinite recursion loop.
4. If the input array contains negative numbers, the pivot selection may not be optimal, leading to incorrect output.
5. If the input array contains floating point numbers, the pivot selection may not be optimal, leading to incorrect output.
6. If the input array is not sorted, the program may return incorrect output for the `k`th element.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case 1

# Test case 2
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Test case 3
arr = [10, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4]
