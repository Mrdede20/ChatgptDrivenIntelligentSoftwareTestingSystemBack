Yes, there is a test case that could trigger a bug in this program. If the input array 'arr' contains values that are greater than or equal to the value of 'k', then the program will throw an IndexError.

For example, if we pass the input array [5, 2, 8, 2] and set 'k' to 5, then the program will try to access the index '8' in array 'counts', which does not exist and will trigger an IndexError. Therefore, we need to ensure that all elements in 'arr' are less than 'k'.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
