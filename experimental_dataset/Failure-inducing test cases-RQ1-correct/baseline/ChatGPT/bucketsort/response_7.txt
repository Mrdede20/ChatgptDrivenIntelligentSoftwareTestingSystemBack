Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. If the input array 'arr' contains any value greater than or equal to the value of 'k', then the program will raise an 'IndexError' exception, as the 'counts' list only has 'k' number of elements. 

For example, if we pass the input array [5, 2, 9, 0, 3] and k=5, the program will raise an 'IndexError' exception when trying to access the 9th index of the 'counts' list.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the 'counts' list with k+1 elements, to accommodate values up to and including k.

Here's the updated program with the fix:

\def bucketsort(arr, k):
\    counts = [0] * (k+1)
\    for x in arr:
\        counts[x] += 1
\
\    sorted_arr = []
\    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
\        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)
\
\    return sorted_arr

Give us such test case. Use assert.
