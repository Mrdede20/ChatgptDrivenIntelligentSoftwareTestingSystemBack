Yes, there is a potential bug in the program. If the input array contains a value greater than or equal to the length of the counts array (i.e. the value of k), the program will throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" error. 

For example, if the input array is [2, 1, 4, 9, 5] and k is 5, the counts array will have length 5. However, the value 9 in the input array is greater than or equal to k, causing the program to fail. 

To avoid this bug, the program should check that each value in the input array is less than k before trying to increment the corresponding count in the counts array.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the bucketsort function using the assert statement:

```
# Test case 1
arr = [3, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 9, 6, 4, 0]
k = 10
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Test case 2
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7]
k = 8
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7]

# Test case 3
arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
k = 10
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In this test case, we have three test cases with different input values. We have used the assert statement to check if the output returned by the bucketsort function matches the expected sorted output. If the test cases pass, the assert statement does not raise any errors.
