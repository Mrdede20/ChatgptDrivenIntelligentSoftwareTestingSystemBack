Yes, there is a test case which can trigger a bug in the program above. 

If the input array "arr" contains a negative value, a "IndexError: list index out of range" error will be raised on line 4 since negative indices are not allowed in Python lists. 

Example test case:

arr = [-1, 0, 2, 2, 1]

k = 3

Expected output: [-1, 0, 1, 2, 2]

Actual output: IndexError: list index out of range

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
# Test case 1
arr = [4, 1, 3, 2]
k = 5
expected_output = [1, 2, 3, 4]
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == expected_output

# Test case 2
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
k = 5
expected_output = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == expected_output

# Test case 3
arr = [-5, 8, 0, -9, 12]
k = 7
expected_output = [-9, -5, 0, 8, 12]
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == expected_output

# Test case 4
arr = []
k = 3
expected_output = []
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == expected_output

# Test case 5
arr = [1]
k = 1
expected_output = [1]
assert bucketsort(arr, k) == expected_output
