Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the above program. Here are some examples:

1. Test case where the height is zero: If the input height is zero, the function should return an empty list. This can be tested using assertion statements like:
```
assert hanoi(0) == []
```

2. Test case where the start and end pegs are the same: If the start and end pegs are the same, the function should still return an empty list since there are no moves to be made. This can be tested using assertion statements like:
```
assert hanoi(3, start=1, end=1) == []
```

3. Test case where the height is a negative number: If the input height is negative, the function should raise an error or return an empty list. This can be tested using a try-except block like:
```
try:
    hanoi(-2)
except:
    assert True
```

4. Test case where the input parameters are not integers: If the input height, start, or end values are not integers, the function should raise an error or return an empty list. This can be tested using a try-except block like:
```
try:
    hanoi("foo")
except:
    assert True
```

5. Test case where the input height is too large: If the input height is too large, the function may take a very long time to run or cause a stack overflow error. This can be tested using a large input value like:
```
assert len(hanoi(20)) == 1048575
```

Give us such test case. Use assert.
