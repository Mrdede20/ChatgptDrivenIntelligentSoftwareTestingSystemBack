Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program. Here are some examples:

1. Test case where all items have the same weight and value:
capacity = 10
items = [(2, 2), (2, 2), (2, 2)]
Expected output: 6
This test case checks if the program is able to handle edge cases where all items have the same weight and value.

2. Test case where the capacity is smaller than the weight of the heaviest item:
capacity = 4
items = [(5, 10), (3, 5), (2, 3)]
Expected output: 0
This test case checks if the program is able to return 0 when the capacity is smaller than the weight of the heaviest item.

3. Test case where some items have negative values:
capacity = 5
items = [(2, 3), (3, -2), (1, 4)]
Expected output: 7
This test case checks if the program is able to handle negative values for some items.

4. Test case where the input list of items is empty:
capacity = 5
items = []
Expected output: 0
This test case checks if the program is able to handle empty input lists of items.

5. Test case where some weights or values are not integers:
capacity = 10
items = [(2.5, 3), (3, 4.5), (2.2, 2.2)]
Expected output: 7.7
This test case checks if the program is able to handle non-integer weights or values for items.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the knapsack function:

def test_knapsack():
    # Test case 1: small items and capacity
    items = [(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
    capacity = 5
    assert knapsack(capacity, items) == 7
    
    # Test case 2: large items and capacity
    items = [(10, 10), (20, 30), (30, 40), (40, 50), (50, 60)]
    capacity = 100
    assert knapsack(capacity, items) == 140
    
    # Test case 3: empty items list
    items = []
    capacity = 10
    assert knapsack(capacity, items) == 0
    
    # Test case 4: capacity is less than any item weight
    items = [(5, 10), (8, 20), (10, 30)]
    capacity = 2
    assert knapsack(capacity, items) == 0
    
    # Test case 5: all items have the same value
    items = [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]
    capacity = 6
    assert knapsack(capacity, items) == 10
