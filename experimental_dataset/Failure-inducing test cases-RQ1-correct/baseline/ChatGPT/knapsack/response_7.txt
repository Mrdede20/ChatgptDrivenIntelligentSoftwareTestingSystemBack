Yes, there could be several test cases that could trigger a bug in the program, but without knowing the requirements and expected behavior of the program, it is difficult to suggest a specific test case. 

However, some potential test cases that could uncover bugs in the program could include:
- Providing a negative capacity or a non-integer value for capacity
- Providing items with negative weight or value
- Providing an empty list of items
- Providing duplicate items with the same weight and value
- Providing items with weights greater than the capacity
- Providing very large inputs (e.g. a high capacity and a large number of items)

It is important to note that testing should not only focus on triggering bugs but also on ensuring the correct functionality of the program by providing meaningful inputs and testing edge cases.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is an example test case for the knapsack function using assert:

def test_knapsack():
\    assert knapsack(50, [(10, 60), (20, 100), (30, 120)]) == 220
\    assert knapsack(10, [(5, 10), (10, 12), (1, 1)]) == 13
\    assert knapsack(20, [(8, 10), (6, 5), (10, 15)]) == 25
\    assert knapsack(0, [(5, 20), (10, 50), (15, 70)]) == 0
\    assert knapsack(30, [(5, 10), (15, 20), (20, 30), (25, 40)]) == 100

In this test case, we are testing the knapsack function with different input combinations to ensure that the function is working as expected. We are using the assert statement to check whether the result of the function matches the expected output. If the function returns the expected output, the assert statement will pass and the test case will be considered successful. If the function does not return the expected output, the assert statement will fail and an AssertionError will be raised.
