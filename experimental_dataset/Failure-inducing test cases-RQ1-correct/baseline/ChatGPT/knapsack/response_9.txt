Yes, there can be test cases that may trigger bugs in the program. For example, if the program is given negative capacity or negative weights or values of the items, it may not work as expected. Also, if there are duplicate items with the same weight and value, it may not handle them properly. Unexpected inputs, such as non-numeric values or non-tuples, may also cause bugs in the program. It is important to thoroughly test the program with various input scenarios to ensure its correctness.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case using the assert method:

def test_knapsack():
\    items = [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 7)]
\    capacity = 5
\    expected = 9 # expected maximum value
\
\    result = knapsack(capacity, items)
\    assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, but got {result}"
