Yes, there are several possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program above.

1. Empty input array: If the input array is empty, the program may encounter errors or produce unexpected outputs.

2. Negative value of k: If the value of k is negative, the program may encounter errors or produce unexpected outputs.

3. Repeated elements in the input array: If there are repeated elements in the input array, the program may not handle them correctly and produce incorrect results.

4. Large input array: If the input array is very large, the program may encounter performance issues, memory errors, or take a very long time to execute.

5. Non-numeric input: If the input array or k value contains non-numeric characters, the program may encounter errors or produce unexpected outputs.

6. Edge case where k is equal to the length of the input array: In this case, the program may not sort the entire array correctly, as it only sorts the first k elements and then appends the remaining elements at the end.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
