Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program above. The bug can occur when the input array `arr` has less than `k` elements. In this case, the program will throw an index out of range error since the line `heap = arr[:k]` will try to access elements beyond the range of the array. To trigger this bug, we can pass an input array that has length less than `k` to the function. For example:

```
arr = [5, 3]
k = 3
list(kheapsort(arr, k))
```

This will result in the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in kheapsort
IndexError: list index out of range
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
