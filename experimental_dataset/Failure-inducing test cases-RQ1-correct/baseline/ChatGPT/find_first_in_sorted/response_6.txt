Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program, such as:

1. Empty array: If the array is empty, the program may not work as expected and may return an incorrect result.

2. Duplicate values: If the array contains duplicate values, the program may not correctly identify the first occurrence of a particular value.

3. Odd-length array: If the array has an odd length, the program may not correctly identify the middle element when calculating the mid index.

4. Negative numbers: If the array contains negative numbers, the program may not work as expected and may return an incorrect result.

5. Large array: If the array is too large, the program may not work efficiently and may run into performance issues.

To trigger a bug in the program, you can try passing in values that fall under any of the above categories and verify if the program returns the expected result.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case that uses assert to check if the function is working as expected:

```python
# Test case for find_first_in_sorted function
def test_find_first_in_sorted():
    arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
    x = 4
    expected_index = 4

    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == expected_index, f"Expected {expected_index} but got {find_first_in_sorted(arr, x)}"

test_find_first_in_sorted()
```

In this test case, we're checking if the `find_first_in_sorted` function returns the correct index of the first occurrence of `x` in the sorted array `arr`. We expect the function to return the index `4`, which is the first occurrence of `x = 4` in the array. We use the `assert` statement to check if the actual output of the function matches the expected output. If the test fails, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` and display the error message we've provided.
