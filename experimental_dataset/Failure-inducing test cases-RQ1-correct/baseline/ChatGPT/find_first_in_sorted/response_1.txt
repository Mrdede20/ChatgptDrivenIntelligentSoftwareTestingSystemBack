Yes, a test case that can trigger a bug in this program is when the input array contains duplicates of the target value. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3] and the target value is 2, the function will return index 1 instead of index 2, which is the first occurrence of the target value in the array.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case using assert:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 3) == 2

This test case verifies that the function correctly finds the first occurrence of the value 3 in the sorted array, which is at index 2. It uses assert to ensure that the expected result matches the actual result returned by the function. If the assertion fails, the test case will raise an AssertionError, indicating that there's a bug in the function.
