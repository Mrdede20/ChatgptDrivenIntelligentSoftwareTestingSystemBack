Yes, a test case to trigger a possible bug in this code is when the input array is empty, i.e. arr = [] and the value of x is any integer. In such case, the program will enter an infinite loop since the value of hi is initialized to the length of the empty array which is zero. Hence, the condition lo < hi is never satisfied and the while loop keeps running, causing the program to hang or crash eventually. To fix this bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the empty array case and return -1 immediately. 

A possible fixed version of the code is:

def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    if not arr:
        return -1
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr)

    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid

        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is an example test case using assert to check if the function find_first_in_sorted returns the correct index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array:

def test_find_first_in_sorted():
\    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7]
\    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 4) == 3
\    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 1) == 0
\    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 7) == 8
\    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 8) == -1
\    assert find_first_in_sorted([], 1) == -1

test_find_first_in_sorted() 

The first four assertions test whether the function returns the correct index for a number that is present in the array. The last assertion tests whether the function returns -1 when the array is empty or the number is not present in the array. Running this test case will help to ensure the correctness of the function implementation.
