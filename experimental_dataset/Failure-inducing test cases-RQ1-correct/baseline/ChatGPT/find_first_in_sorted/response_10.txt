Yes, there are multiple test cases that could potentially trigger bugs in the program. Here are a few examples:

1. Invalid input: If the arr parameter is not a sorted list, the function may not work as intended. For example:

    arr = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
    x = 3
    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == -1

2. Edge case: If the target value x is less than the first element of the array, the function may return an incorrect result. For example:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    x = 0
    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == -1

3. Edge case: If the target value x is greater than the last element of the array, the function may return an incorrect result. For example:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    x = 6
    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == -1

4. Duplicate values: If there are duplicate values in the array and the target value x matches one of these duplicates, the function may not return the index of the first occurrence. For example:

    arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
    x = 3
    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == 2

5. Large input: If the input array is very large, the function may run into issues with memory or performance. For example:

    arr = list(range(10000000))
    x = 9999999
    assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, x) == 9999999

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the above function using assert:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 5) == 4
