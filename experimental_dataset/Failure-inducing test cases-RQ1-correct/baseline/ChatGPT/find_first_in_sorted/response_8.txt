Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger potential bugs in the program below:

1. Testing with an empty array: If the arr parameter passed to the function is an empty list, the program may not behave as expected.

2. Testing with an array with only one element: If the arr parameter passed to the function is an array with only one element, the program may not behave as expected.

3. Testing with an array where the value of x is greater than all the elements: If the value of x passed as a parameter to the function is greater than all the elements in the array, the program may not behave as expected.

4. Testing with an array where the value of x is smaller than all the elements: If the value of x passed as a parameter to the function is smaller than all the elements in the array, the program may not behave as expected.

5. Testing with an array that contains duplicates: If the arr parameter passed to the function contains duplicates, the program may not behave as expected.

6. Testing with an array that is not sorted: If the arr parameter passed to the function is not sorted, the program may not behave as expected.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the above code:

def test_find_first_in_sorted():
\    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 4) == 3)
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 5) == 6)
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 1) == 0)
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 6) == 8)
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 7) == -1)
\    assert(find_first_in_sorted(arr, 0) == -1)

This test case checks if the function is able to correctly find the index of the first occurrence of a given element in a sorted array. The test case includes scenarios where the element is present multiple times in the array, and cases where the element is not present at all.
