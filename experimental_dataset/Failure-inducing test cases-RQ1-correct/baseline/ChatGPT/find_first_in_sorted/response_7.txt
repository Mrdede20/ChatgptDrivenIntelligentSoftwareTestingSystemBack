Yes, a test case that could trigger a bug in the program is when the input array is empty ([]), and the value to be searched for (x) is any integer. In this case, the program would try to access an element in an empty array (at line 3) and throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception. The program should handle the case of an empty array gracefully and return -1.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's an example test case:

arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr, 5) == 2

Explanation: The element 5 is found at index 2 in the array. The function find_first_in_sorted should return the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array, so the assertion checks that it returns 2, which is the correct index.
