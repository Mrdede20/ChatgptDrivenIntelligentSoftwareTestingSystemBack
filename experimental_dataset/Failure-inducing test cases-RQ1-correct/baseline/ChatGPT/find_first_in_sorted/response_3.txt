Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. The bug can be triggered if the value of x is not in the array but is greater than the largest element in the array. In this case, the program will return -1 instead of the correct result. Here is an example:

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
x = 60
result = find_first_in_sorted(arr, x)
assert result == -1, f"Expected -1 but got {result}"

In this test case, the value of x (60) is greater than the largest element in the array (50), so the program should return -1. However, because the while loop condition (lo < hi) is false, the program will not enter the loop and will return -1 without checking the value x. This is the bug in the program.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1: x is present in arr
arr1 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
x1 = 8
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr1, x1) == 3

# Test Case 2: x is not present in arr
arr2 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
x2 = 2
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr2, x2) == -1

# Test Case 3: x is the first element of arr
arr3 = [10, 12, 14, 16]
x3 = 10
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr3, x3) == 0

# Test Case 4: x is the last element of arr
arr4 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
x4 = 7
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr4, x4) == 3

# Test Case 5: arr has only one element which is equal to x
arr5 = [6]
x5 = 6
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr5, x5) == 0

# Test Case 6: arr has only one element which is not equal to x
arr6 = [5]
x6 = 8
assert find_first_in_sorted(arr6, x6) == -1
