One possible test case that can trigger a bug in the program is when the input array contains negative numbers. For example:

arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

This input array has a longest increasing subsequence of length 4, which is [1, 4, 2, 4]. However, if the program is not properly handling negative numbers, it might produce an incorrect result. Specifically, the prefix_lengths list computed for the element -3 could be [1, 2] instead of [1], if the condition arr[ends[j]] < val is not treating negative numbers correctly. This could lead to an incorrect value for the length variable and an incorrect update of the ends dictionary, resulting in a wrong output.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case that can be used to test the `lis()` function:

```
def test_lis():
    arr1 = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
    assert lis(arr1) == 4
    
    arr2 = [1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 7, 6, 8]
    assert lis(arr2) == 6
    
    arr3 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    assert lis(arr3) == 1
    
    arr4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert lis(arr4) == 5
    
    arr5 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert lis(arr5) == 4
```

In this test case, we define a `test_lis()` function that contains 5 test cases. Each test case consists of an input array and an expected output value. We use the `assert` statement to check if the actual output value returned by the `lis()` function matches the expected output value. If the actual and expected values do not match, an assertion error will be raised.
