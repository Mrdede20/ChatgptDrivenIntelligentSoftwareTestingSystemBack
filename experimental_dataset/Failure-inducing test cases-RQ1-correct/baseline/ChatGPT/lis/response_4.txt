Yes, there are many test cases that could potentially trigger a bug in this program. Here are a few examples:

1. A simple test case with an empty array: 

```
input: []
expected output: 0
```

2. A test case with an array with only one element:

```
input: [5]
expected output: 1
```

3. A test case with an array with repeated elements:

```
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
expected output: 1
```

4. A test case with an array in descending order:

```
input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
expected output: 1
```

5. A test case with an array in ascending order:

```
input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
expected output: 5
```

6. A test case with a mix of ascending and descending elements:

```
input: [1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3]
expected output: 4
```

7. A test case with a large input array:

```
input: list(range(10000))
expected output: 10000
```

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case 1
arr1 = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
assert lis(arr1) == 4

# Test case 2
arr2 = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
assert lis(arr2) == 9

# Test case 3
arr3 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
assert lis(arr3) == 1

# Test case 4
arr4 = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3, 6]
assert lis(arr4) == 4

# Test case 5
arr5 = []
assert lis(arr5) == 0
