Yes, there could be multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. For example:

1. When the input array is empty or contains only one element.
2. When the input array contains duplicate elements.
3. When the input array is not sorted in ascending order.
4. When the length of the longest increasing subsequence is greater than the length of the input array.
5. When the program returns the length of the longest decreasing subsequence instead of longest increasing subsequence for a decreasing input array.
6. When the program does not consider the first element of the input array as part of the longest increasing subsequence.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the `lis` function:

```
def test_lis():
    arr1 = [3, 1, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 2, 8]
    assert lis(arr1) == 5
    
    arr2 = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
    assert lis(arr2) == 4
    
    arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert lis(arr3) == 5
    
    arr4 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    assert lis(arr4) == 1
    
    arr5 = []
    assert lis(arr5) == 0
```

This test case contains five arrays with different inputs, and the assertion statements check whether the output of the `lis` function matches the expected output. If any of the assertions fail, it means that there is an error in the implementation.
