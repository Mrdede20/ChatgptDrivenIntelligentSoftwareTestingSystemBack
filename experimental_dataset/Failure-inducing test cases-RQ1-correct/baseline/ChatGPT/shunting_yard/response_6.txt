Yes, there is a potential bug in this program. If the input tokens list contains an operator that is not listed in the precedence dictionary (e.g. '%'), the program will raise a KeyError when trying to access the precedence value for that operator. To fix this, the program could check whether the operator is in the precedence dictionary before trying to access its value, and handle unknown operators accordingly (e.g. by raising an exception, skipping the token, or defaulting to a lower precedence value). Here is an example test case that could trigger this bug:

```
tokens = [3, '+', 4, '%', 2]
result = shunting_yard(tokens)
# expected result: [3, 4, '+', 2, '%']
# actual result: KeyError: '%'
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case using assert:

def test_shunting_yard():
\    tokens = [3, '+', 4, '*', 2, '/', 1, '-', 5]
\    expected_result = [3, 4, 2, '*', 1, '/', '+', 5, '-']
\
\    assert shunting_yard(tokens) == expected_result

This test case verifies that when the input tokens are [3, '+', 4, '*', 2, '/', 1, '-', 5], the output of the shunting_yard() function matches the expected output of [3, 4, 2, '*', 1, '/', '+', 5, '-']. By using assert, we can ensure that the function returns the expected value, and if it does not, the test framework will indicate that the test has failed.
