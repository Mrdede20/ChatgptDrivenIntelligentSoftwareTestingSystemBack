Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. If the input tokens contain a combination of integers and non-supported operators (e.g. '^'), the program may raise a KeyError exception when trying to access an unsupported operator in the precedence dictionary.

2. If there are mismatched parentheses in the input tokens (e.g. '(3+2)*5('), the program may enter an infinite loop or raise an IndexError exception when trying to access an index beyond the bounds of the opstack list.

3. If the input tokens contain a division by zero (e.g. '4/0'), the program may raise a ZeroDivisionError exception when trying to evaluate the expression.

4. If the input tokens are not in a valid postfix notation (i.e. Reverse Polish Notation), the program may produce incorrect output or raise an IndexError exception when trying to append the last operator in the opstack.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case:
tokens = ['(', 2, '+', 3, ')', '*', 4]
result = shunting_yard(tokens)
assert result == [2, 3, '+', 4, '*'], "Test case failed"
