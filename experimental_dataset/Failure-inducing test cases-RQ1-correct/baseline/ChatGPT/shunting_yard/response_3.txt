Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above. One potential test case is:

```
tokens = [2, '*', 3, '+', 4, '/', 2]
shunting_yard(tokens)
```

This test case includes both multiplication and division, which have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. However, the program may incorrectly evaluate the expression as `2 3 * 4 2 / +`, which would result in a final answer of 7.0 instead of the correct answer of 7.5.

Another test case that may trigger a bug is:

```
tokens = [2, '+', 3, '*', 4, '/', 2]
shunting_yard(tokens)
```

This test case includes multiplication before division before addition, which may cause the program to incorrectly evaluate the expression as `2 3 4 * 2 / +`, resulting in a final answer of 8.0 instead of the correct answer of 5.0.

Overall, there may be many potential test cases that can trigger bugs in this program depending on the specific inputs and expressions used.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
