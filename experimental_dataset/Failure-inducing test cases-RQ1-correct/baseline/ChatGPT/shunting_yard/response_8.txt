Yes, here is a possible test case that could trigger a bug in the program:

```
tokens = [2, '+', 3, '+', '*']
result = shunting_yard(tokens)
```

This test case contains two adjacent operators (`+` and `*`) with the same precedence, which could cause the shunting yard algorithm to fail to correctly prioritize the operations. Specifically, the algorithm might attempt to push the `*` operator onto the stack before the `+` operator has been processed, resulting in an invalid postfix expression. Depending on how the program handles such input, it may raise an error or produce an incorrect result.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case that checks if the output of the shunting_yard function is correct when given a set of input tokens:

def test_shunting_yard():
    tokens = [2, '+', 3, '*', 4]
    expected_output = [2, 3, 4, '*', '+']
    
    assert(shunting_yard(tokens) == expected_output)
