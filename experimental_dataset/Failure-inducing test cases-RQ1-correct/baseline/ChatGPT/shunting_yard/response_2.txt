Yes, there are several possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program. Here are a few examples:

1. Test case with incorrect token type:
tokens = ['1', '+', '2']
The program expects integer tokens, but this test case includes string tokens, which can cause an error or unexpected behavior.

2. Test case with invalid operator:
tokens = [1, '!', 2]
The program only supports the operators '+', '-', '*', and '/', but this test case includes an invalid operator. Depending on how the program is implemented, this could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

3. Test case with unbalanced parentheses:
tokens = ['(', 1, '+', 2]
The program does not handle parentheses, so if this test case is passed in, it could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

4. Test case with ambiguous precedence:
tokens = [1, '+', 2, '*', 3]
The program uses a simple precedence rule to determine the order of operations, but this test case includes two operators ('+' and '*') with the same precedence level. Depending on how the program is implemented, this could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the shunting_yard function:

def test_shunting_yard():
    assert shunting_yard([2, '+', 3, '*', 4]) == [2, 3, 4, '*', '+']
    assert shunting_yard([10, '/', 2, '+', 3, '*', 4]) == [10, 2, '/', 3, 4, '*', '+']
    assert shunting_yard([5, '-', 6, '*', 7, '/', 3]) == [5, 6, 7, '*', 3, '/', '-']

test_shunting_yard()

The assert statement checks if the expected output of the function matches the actual output. If the output is not as expected, the test case will fail.
