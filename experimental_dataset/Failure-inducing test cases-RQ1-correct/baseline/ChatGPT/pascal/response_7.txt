Yes, there are multiple test cases that could trigger bugs in the program:

1. If n is less than or equal to 0, the program will return an empty list instead of raising an error, which may cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the program. A test case for this scenario could be pascal(0) or pascal(-1).

2. Due to the use of the ternary operator in the inner loop, if there is a typo in the syntax, such as a missing colon or comma, it may result in a syntax error that stops the program from running. A test case for this scenario could be pascal(5)) with a syntax error inserted into the code.

3. If the program encounters a mathematical error, such as an integer overflow or division by zero, it may crash or produce incorrect output. A test case for this scenario could be pascal(100), which generates an array with 100 rows and may overflow the integer datatype.

4. If the program contains logic errors, such as using the wrong variable or calculation, it may produce incorrect output without raising any exceptions or errors. A test case for this scenario could be pascal(4), which should produce the following output: [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]. If the output is different, there may be a logic error in the code.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert:

```
def test_pascal():
    assert pascal(0) == [[1]]
    assert pascal(1) == [[1], [1, 1]]
    assert pascal(2) == [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]
    assert pascal(5) == [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1], [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]]
    assert pascal(10) == [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1], [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1], [1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1], [1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1], [1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1], [1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1], [1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1]]    
```

In this test case, we're testing the `pascal` function with various input sizes and asserting that the output matches the expected values. If any of the assertions fail, the test will raise an AssertionError, indicating that there's a problem with the implementation of the function.
