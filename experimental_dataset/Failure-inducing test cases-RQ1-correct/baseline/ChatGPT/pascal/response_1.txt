Yes, there are many possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program. Here are some examples:

- Negative input: If the function is called with n < 0, it should raise an exception or return an error message. Testing this case ensures that the program handles invalid input properly.
- Zero input: If the function is called with n = 0, it should return an empty list or a list with one element that is equal to [1]. This case tests if the program can handle edge cases correctly.
- Large input: If the function is called with a very large n, say n = 1000, the program may run into performance issues or memory errors. Testing this case can reveal scalability problems in the code.
- Invalid indexing: The program uses indexing to access elements of the rows list, which may cause errors if the indices are out of bounds. Testing cases where r or c are negative or greater than n can trigger such errors.
- Precision errors: The program computes the binomial coefficients using integer arithmetic, which may overflow for large values of n. Testing cases where the result should be a large number can reveal precision errors and incorrect results.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
