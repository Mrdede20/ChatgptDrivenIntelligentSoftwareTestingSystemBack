Yes, there are several possible test cases that could trigger a bug in the program. For example:

1. Test case where the input array is empty (i.e. len(arr) == 0). In this case, the program will call binsearch(0, 0), which will immediately return -1 without searching anything. However, the correct behavior according to the function's documentation would be to return -1 only if x is not found in the array, and to raise an error if the input array is empty. Therefore, this could be considered a bug.

2. Test case where the input array contains duplicate values. Depending on the implementation details of the binsearch function, it might not always return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, but rather a different occurrence. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] and x = 2, the function could return either index 1 or index 2, depending on how the algorithm breaks ties. This might not always be the desired behavior, especially if the caller assumes that the function always returns the first occurrence.

3. Test case where the input array is not sorted in ascending order. If the array is not sorted, there is no guarantee that the binary search algorithm will find x even if it is present in the array. Depending on the particular implementation of the algorithm, this could manifest as an infinite loop, a segmentation fault, or some other crash or error. Therefore, the function should either check that the array is sorted before starting the search, or raise an error if it is not. If it doesn't do so, this could be considered a bug.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

To test the above function, here's a sample test case using assert:

```
def test_find_in_sorted():
    # Test case 1
    arr = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
    x = 5
    expected_output = 3
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, x) == expected_output
    
    # Test case 2
    arr = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
    x = 2
    expected_output = -1
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, x) == expected_output
    
    # Test case 3
    arr = []
    x = 2
    expected_output = -1
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, x) == expected_output
    
    # Test case 4
    arr = [1]
    x = 1
    expected_output = 0
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, x) == expected_output
```

In the above test case, we first define a function `test_find_in_sorted()` which comprises of four individual test cases.

For each test case, we define an input array `arr`, some value `x`, and an `expected_output`. We then make use of the `assert` statement to verify that the function `find_in_sorted()` returns the expected output.

If the function returns the expected output, `assert` has no effect and the code moves to the next test case. However, if the function returns an unexpected output, an error is raised and the message is displayed along with the `assert` statement that failed.
