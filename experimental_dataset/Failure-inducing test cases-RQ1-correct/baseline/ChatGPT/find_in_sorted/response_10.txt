Yes, a test case that triggers a bug in the program would be providing an empty list as input. When trying to execute the line `return binsearch(0, len(arr))`, the length of the empty list will be 0, which will make the `binsearch` function return -1 without being able to check any elements of the list. However, the function is supposed to be used only with sorted lists, which should never be empty.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1: x is present in the array
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
assert (find_in_sorted(arr1, 3) == 2)

# Test Case 2: x is not present in the array
arr2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
assert (find_in_sorted(arr2, 6) == -1)

# Test Case 3: x is the first element in the array
arr3 = [1,2,3,4,5]
assert (find_in_sorted(arr3, 1) == 0)

# Test Case 4: x is the last element in the array
arr4 = [1,2,3,4,5]
assert (find_in_sorted(arr4, 5) == 4)

# Test Case 5: x is present twice in the array
arr5 = [1,2,3,4,4]
assert (find_in_sorted(arr5, 4) == 3)
