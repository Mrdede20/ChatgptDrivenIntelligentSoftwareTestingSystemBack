Yes, there are test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. Some possible test cases are:

1. Empty array: if the input array is empty, the program can go into an infinite loop because the base case of the binary search function (start == end) is never reached, and the function keeps calling itself with the same arguments indefinitely. To trigger this bug, you can call the function with an empty list, e.g. find_in_sorted([], 42).

2. Element not in array: if the element we are searching for is not in the array, the program should return -1, indicating that the element was not found. However, if the element is greater than all elements in the array, the binary search function can go out of bounds and throw an IndexError, because the condition x < arr[mid] becomes False for all values of mid, and the function keeps calling itself with end = mid, which eventually becomes len(arr) + 1. To trigger this bug, you can call the function with an array that does not contain the element and x greater than all elements, e.g. find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3], 4).

3. Array with duplicates: if the input array contains duplicate values, the program may return the wrong index for a given element, because the binary search function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the element it finds. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] and we are searching for 3, the program will return index 3 instead of 4 or 5. To trigger this bug, you can call the function with an array that has duplicates and an element that appears more than once, e.g. find_in_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], 3).

4. Array with negative values: if the input array contains negative values, the program may go out of bounds or return the wrong index if the element we are searching for is smaller than all elements in the array. This is because the mid index is calculated by integer division, which rounds towards zero, so if the start index is negative, the mid index can become negative as well, and accessing arr[mid] can raise an IndexError or return the wrong value. To trigger this bug, you can call the function with an array that contains negative values and an element smaller than all elements, e.g. find_in_sorted([-3, -2, -1], -4).

Give us such test case. Use assert.

One test case could be:

```
def test_find_in_sorted():
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 3) == 2
    
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 6) == -1
    
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 0) == -1
    
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 1) == 0
    
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 5) == 4
```

These assertions test the function for:

- The element that is found in the middle of the list
- The element that is not present in the list
- The element that is less than the smallest element in the list
- The first element in the list
- The last element in the list

If any of these assertions fail, it indicates that the `find_in_sorted` function is not working correctly.
