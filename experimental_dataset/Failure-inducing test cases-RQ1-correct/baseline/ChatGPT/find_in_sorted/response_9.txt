Yes, there are several possible test cases that could trigger a bug in the program above:

1. Edge case: empty array input
   arr = [], x = 5 -> should return -1 
2. Edge case: array with one element that is not equal to x
   arr = [3], x = 5 -> should return -1
3. Edge case: array with one element that is equal to x
   arr = [5], x = 5 -> should return 0
4. Average case: array with multiple elements, x not in array
   arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8], x = 5 -> should return -1
5. Average case: array with multiple elements, x in array
   arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8], x = 2 -> should return 1
6. Average case: array with multiple repeated elements, x in array
   arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], x = 3 -> should return 3.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case

arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

assert find_in_sorted(arr1, 5) == 2
assert find_in_sorted(arr2, 4) == 1
assert find_in_sorted(arr3, 1) == 0
assert find_in_sorted(arr3, 10) == 9
assert find_in_sorted(arr3, 7) == 6
