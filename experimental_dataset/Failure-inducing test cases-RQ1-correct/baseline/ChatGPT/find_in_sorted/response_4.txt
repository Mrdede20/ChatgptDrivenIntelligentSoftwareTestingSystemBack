Yes, there are several potential test cases that could trigger bugs in the program:

1. Empty array input: If an empty array is passed in as an argument to the find_in_sorted function, the program will enter an infinite loop as the base case of start == end will never be reached.

2. Missing target value: If the target value x is not present in the input array, the program will return -1, indicating that the value was not found. However, if the input array is not sorted, this behavior may not be correct as the binary search algorithm assumes a sorted input.

3. Large input array: If the input array is very large, the recursion depth of the binsearch function may exceed the maximum recursion depth allowed by Python, resulting in a "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error.

4. Duplicate input values: If the input array contains duplicate values, the binary search algorithm may not correctly identify the index of the target value as it may find a different value with the same value as the target value but different index.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

To test the 'find_in_sorted' function, we can create a test case where we have a list of numbers and we want to search for a given number in the list. We can use the 'assert' statement to check if the function returns the expected output.

Here is an example test case:

```
def test_find_in_sorted():
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    # Test for element in the list
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 5) == 4
    # Test for element not in the list
    assert find_in_sorted(arr, 10) == -1
    # Test for empty list
    assert find_in_sorted([], 5) == -1
    # Test for single element list
    assert find_in_sorted([5], 5) == 0
```

In this test case, we first create a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and test the function with different inputs.

In the first test, we search for '5', which is in the list, and expect to get the index where '5' is located. We assert that the function returns 4, which is the correct index.

In the second test, we search for '10', which is not in the list, and expect to get '-1' as output. We assert that the function returns '-1', which is the correct output.

In the third test, we check if the function handles an empty list as input. We expect the function to return '-1' in this case, which is the correct output.

Finally, in the fourth test, we test the function with a single-element list that contains the number we are searching for. We expect the function to return 0, which is the correct index.
