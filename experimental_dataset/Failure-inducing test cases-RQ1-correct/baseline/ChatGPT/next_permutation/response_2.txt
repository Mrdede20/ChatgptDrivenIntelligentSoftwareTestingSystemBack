Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger bugs in the program above. Here are some examples:

1. Input with two identical elements:
If the input array "perm" contains two identical elements, then the "next_permutation" function will not be able to compute the correct next permutation. For example, consider the input [1,1]. The function will return [1,1], which is incorrect. 

2. Input with descending order:
If the input array "perm" is sorted in descending order, then the "next_permutation" function will not be able to compute the next permutation correctly. For example, consider the input [3,2,1]. The function will return [3,1,2], which is incorrect. 

3. Input with only one element:
If the input array "perm" has only one element, then the "next_permutation" function will return the same element as the output, which is not a valid next permutation. For example, consider the input [5]. The function will return [5], which is incorrect. 

4. Input with repeated elements:
If the input array "perm" has repeated elements, then the "next_permutation" function may not compute the correct next permutation, depending on their positions. For example, consider the input [1,2,2]. The function will return [2,1,2], which is incorrect. 

Note: There may be other test cases that can trigger bugs in the program, depending on the specific implementation and requirements of the function.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the `next_permutation` function using the `assert` statement:

```
def test_next_permutation():
    perm1 = [1, 2, 3]
    assert next_permutation(perm1) == [1, 3, 2]

    perm2 = [3, 2, 1]
    assert next_permutation(perm2) == None

    perm3 = [1, 1, 5]
    assert next_permutation(perm3) == [1, 5, 1]

    perm4 = [1, 3, 2]
    assert next_permutation(perm4) == [2, 1, 3]
```

The `test_next_permutation` function contains four assertions that test different inputs and expected outputs for the `next_permutation` function. The `assert` statement will raise an assertion error if the expected output is not returned by the function.
