Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program. Here are some examples:

1. An input list with repeated elements, such as [1, 2, 2]. This input will cause the function to return a repeated permutation, since the implementation does not take into account repeated elements.

2. An input list with only one element, such as [1]. This input will cause the function to return None, since there is no next permutation for a list with only one element.

3. An input list that is already sorted in descending order, such as [3, 2, 1]. This input will cause the function to return a list that is not the next permutation, since the implementation does not handle this case correctly.

4. An input list that contains negative numbers, such as [-1, 2, 3]. This input will cause the function to fail, since the implementation assumes that all elements in the list are non-negative.

5. An input list that is too large to handle efficiently, such as [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]. This input will cause the function to take a very long time to execute, since the implementation uses nested loops to generate all possible permutations.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert to check if the function next_permutation correctly generates the next lexicographically greater permutation of a given list:

# Test Case 1
perm = [1, 2, 3]
expected = [1, 3, 2]
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 1 Failed"

# Test Case 2
perm = [3, 2, 1]
expected = None
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 2 Failed"

# Test Case 3
perm = [1, 1, 5]
expected = [1, 5, 1]
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 3 Failed"

# Test Case 4
perm = [4, 3, 2, 1]
expected = None
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 4 Failed"

# Test Case 5
perm = [1, 2, 3, 4]
expected = [1, 2, 4, 3]
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 5 Failed"

# Test Case 6
perm = [1, 1, 1, 1]
expected = None
assert next_permutation(perm) == expected, "Test Case 6 Failed"

print("All test cases passed!")
