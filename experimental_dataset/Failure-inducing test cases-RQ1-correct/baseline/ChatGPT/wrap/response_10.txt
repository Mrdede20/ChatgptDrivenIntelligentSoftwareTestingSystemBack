Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. One such test case is when the input text string has a word that is longer than the number of columns specified. In this scenario, the program will not be able to wrap the text properly and may result in lines that are longer than the specified number of columns. For example, if we pass the input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and the number of columns as 10, the program will not be able to wrap the word "jumps" and may result in a line that is longer than 10 characters.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case for the wrap function:

```
def test_wrap():
    text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed non risus.'
    cols = 20
    expected = [
        'Lorem ipsum dolor',
        'sit amet,',
        'consectetur',
        'adipiscing elit. Sed',
        'non risus.'
    ]
    result = wrap(text, cols)
    assert result == expected, f'Expected {expected}, but got {result}'
```

This test case will pass if the wrap function correctly wraps the text into lines with a maximum of 20 characters and breaks at spaces. The assert statement will trigger an error message if the expected output doesn't match the actual output.
