Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program above. One possible case is when the input text is a long string without any spaces and the column width (cols) is smaller than the length of the text. In this scenario, the program will keep appending the text to the last line until it exceeds the column width, leading to an output with the last line being longer than the specified width. 

For example, if we call the function with wrap("abcdefghij", 3), the output will be ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'j'], which is not correct since the last line has more than three characters.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is an example test case for the wrap function using assert:

# Test case for wrap function
def test_wrap():
    text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis a pulvinar ante."
    cols = 20
    expected_result = ['Lorem ipsum dolor', 'sit amet,', 'consectetur', 'adipiscing elit.', 'Duis a pulvinar', 'ante.']

    assert wrap(text, cols) == expected_result

In this test case, we expect the wrap function to correctly wrap the given text into lines of the specified length (cols). We use assert to check whether the actual result returned by the function matches the expected result. If the test passes, no output is produced. If the test fails, an assertion error will be raised.
