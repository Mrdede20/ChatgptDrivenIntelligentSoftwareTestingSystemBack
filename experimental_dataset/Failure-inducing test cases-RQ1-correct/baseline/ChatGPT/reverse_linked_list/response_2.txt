There is no specific test case provided, but there are general scenarios where the program may fail. 

One potential scenario where the program could fail is if there are duplicate nodes in the linked list. The current implementation doesn't check for duplicates, so if there are nodes with the same values, it could cause issues in the reversal process. 

Another scenario could be if the linked list is circular. In this case, the reversal process would keep iterating endlessly, since there is no end to the linked list. 

To create a test case, we could create a linked list with duplicate nodes or a circular linked list and test if the reversal process works correctly in these situations.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Test Case:

# Create nodes
n1 = Node(value=1)
n2 = Node(value=2)
n3 = Node(value=3)

# Link the nodes
n1.successor = n2
n2.successor = n3

# Test the reverse_linked_list function
assert reverse_linked_list(n1) == n3
assert n3.successor == n2
assert n2.successor == n1
assert n1.successor is None

# Test the successor, predecessors and successors functions of Node class
assert n1.successor == n2
assert n2.successors == [n3]
assert n3.successors == []
assert n3.predecessors == [n2]
assert n2.predecessors == [n1]
assert n1.predecessors == []

# Test the incoming_nodes and outgoing_nodes attributes
assert n1.outgoing_nodes == [n2]
assert n2.incoming_nodes == [n1]
assert n2.outgoing_nodes == [n3]
assert n3.incoming_nodes == [n2]
