Yes, there are several test cases that could potentially trigger bugs in this program.

1. Test case where the source node is not included in the weight_by_edge dictionary.
For example,
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {('B', 'C'): 3, ('C', 'D'): 4}
This may cause the program to throw a KeyError when trying to access the weight of the edges connected to the source node.

2. Test case where there is a negative weight cycle.
For example,
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 2, ('B', 'C'): 1, ('C', 'A'): -5}
The program should detect the presence of a negative weight cycle and return an appropriate error message. However, if there is a bug in the implementation of the cycle detection, it may not detect the cycle or return an incorrect result.

3. Test case where there are multiple shortest paths.
For example,
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 1, ('A', 'C'): 2, ('B', 'D'): 3, ('C', 'D'): 2}
The program should return the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes. However, if there are multiple paths with the same minimum weight, the program may not return all of them or may return them in an incorrect order.

4. Test case where there are isolated nodes.
For example,
source = 'A'
weight_by_edge = {('A', 'B'): 1, ('C', 'D'): 2}
The program should handle isolated nodes correctly and assign an infinite weight to them. If there is a bug in the implementation, it may not handle isolated nodes correctly and return an incorrect result.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
