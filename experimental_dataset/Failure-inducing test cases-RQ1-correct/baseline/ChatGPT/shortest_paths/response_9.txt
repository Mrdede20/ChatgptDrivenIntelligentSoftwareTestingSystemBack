Yes, there are several test cases that could potentially trigger a bug in the program above. Some examples include:

1. Test case where there is a negative weight cycle in the graph. This could cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

2. Test case where there is a disconnected node in the graph. This could cause the algorithm to produce incorrect results, as it assumes that all nodes are reachable from the source node.

3. Test case where there are duplicate edges in the graph. This could cause the algorithm to produce incorrect results, as it assumes that each edge weight is unique.

4. Test case where the input graph is very large. This could cause the algorithm to run out of memory or take an extremely long time to complete.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
