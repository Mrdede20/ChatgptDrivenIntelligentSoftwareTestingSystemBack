Yes, there could be a test case that triggers a bug in this program. 

One possible bug could occur if there is a negative-weight cycle in the graph represented by the weight_by_edge dictionary. In such a case, the program may not terminate or may return incorrect shortest path weights. 

To test for this, a test case with a negative-weight cycle in the graph should be constructed. For example: 

```
weight_by_edge = {
    (1, 2): 3,
    (2, 3): 1,
    (3, 4): 2,
    (4, 2): -6   # negative-weight cycle (4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4)
}
source = 1

shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge)
```

This input would trigger the bug because the algorithm would endlessly update the weights of nodes 2, 3, and 4 in the weight_by_node dictionary without convergence. 

To fix this issue, the program could be modified to detect negative-weight cycles before processing the shortest paths.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
