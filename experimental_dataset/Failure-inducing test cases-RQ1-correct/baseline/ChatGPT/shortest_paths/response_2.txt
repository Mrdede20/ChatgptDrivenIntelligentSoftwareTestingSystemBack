Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. Case when there is a negative weight cycle in the graph. This can result in an incorrect shortest path calculation due to the algorithm not being designed to handle negative weight cycles.

2. Case when there are duplicate edges between two nodes. This can result in the algorithm calculating an incorrect shortest path as it will only consider one of the edges while ignoring the other(s).

3. Case when the graph is disconnected. This can result in the algorithm returning incorrect shortest paths for nodes that are not reachable from the source node.

4. Case when the source node is not present in the graph. This will result in an error or an incorrect shortest path calculation as the algorithm requires the source node to be present in the graph.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the `shortest_paths` function:

def test_shortest_paths():
\    weight_by_edge = {
\        (0, 1): 3,
\        (0, 3): 2,
\        (1, 2): 1,
\        (1, 3): 4,
\        (2, 4): 6,
\        (3, 1): 2,
\        (3, 2): 5,
\        (3, 4): 7,
\        (4, 0): 3,
\        (4, 2): 4,
\    }
\    assert shortest_paths(0, weight_by_edge) == {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 6}

This test case creates a graph with 5 nodes and 10 edges, and verifies that the shortest paths from node 0 to all other nodes are correct. The `assert` statement checks that the result dictionary matches the expected values.
