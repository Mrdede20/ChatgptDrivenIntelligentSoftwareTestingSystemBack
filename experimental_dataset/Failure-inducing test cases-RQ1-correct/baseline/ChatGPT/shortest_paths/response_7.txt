Yes, there are several test cases that could potentially trigger a bug in the program. One example is if the weight_by_edge dictionary contains a negative weight cycle, which would cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop and never converge on the correct shortest paths. Another example is if the weight_by_edge dictionary contains a disconnected graph, in which case some nodes may never be reached and their shortest path weights may not be correctly calculated. Additionally, if the weight_by_edge dictionary contains duplicate edges with different weights, the algorithm may not converge on the correct shortest paths.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
