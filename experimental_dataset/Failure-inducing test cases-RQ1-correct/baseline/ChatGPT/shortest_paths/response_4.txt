Yes, there are multiple potential test cases that could trigger bugs in this program. Here are some examples:

1. Test Case for Negative Weights: If there exists a negative weight in the graph, then this program may not work properly. A test case could be:

`shortest_paths(1, {(1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 4, (1, 3): -6})`
Expected Output: `{1: 0, 2: 2, 3: -4}`

If the program is not properly handling negative weights, then the output could be incorrect.

2. Test Case for Disconnected Graphs: If the graph is disconnected, then the program may not return the correct shortest paths for all nodes. A test case could be:

`shortest_paths(1, {(1, 2): 2, (3, 4): 3})`
Expected Output: `{1: 0, 2: 2, 3: inf, 4: inf}`

If the program is not properly handling disconnected graphs, then it may return incorrect output.

3. Test Case for Self-Loops: If there are self-loops in the graph, then the program may not work properly. A test case could be:

`shortest_paths(1, {(1, 1): 1, (1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 4})`
Expected Output: `{1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 6}`

If the program is not properly handling self-loops, it may not return the correct output.

4. Test Case for Infinite Loops: If there is a cycle with a negative weight in the graph, then the program may end up in an infinite loop. A test case could be:

`shortest_paths(1, {(1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 3, (3, 2): -5})`
Expected Output: `{1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 5}`

If the program is not properly handling cycles with negative weights, it may get stuck in an infinite loop and not return the correct output.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
