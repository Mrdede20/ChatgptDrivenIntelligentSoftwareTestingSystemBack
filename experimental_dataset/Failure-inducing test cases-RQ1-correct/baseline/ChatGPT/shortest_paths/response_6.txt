Yes, there are several possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. Test case with negative weights: If there is at least one negative weight in the edge weights passed to the function, the shortest_paths function will not work properly because it assumes that all weight values are positive. This can lead to incorrect shortest path results.

2. Test case with disconnected graph: If the graph is not connected, it is possible that not all nodes will be reachable from the source node, which may result in incorrect shortest path values for some nodes.

3. Test case with cycles: If the graph contains cycles, the function may enter an infinite loop and never terminate, or it may produce incorrect shortest path values due to the presence of negative-weight cycles.

4. Test case with duplicate edge weights: If two or more edges have the same weight, the function may choose the wrong edge during the shortest path calculation, which can result in incorrect shortest path values.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case:

def test_shortest_paths():
    weight_by_edge = {
        (0, 1): 1,
        (0, 2): 3,
        (1, 2): 1,
        (2, 3): 2,
        (1, 3): 4
    }
    assert shortest_paths(0, weight_by_edge) == {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4}
