Yes, there are several test cases that could potentially trigger a bug in the program. Here are a few examples:

1. If the weight_by_edge dictionary is empty, the program could raise an exception when trying to iterate over its items.

2. If the source node is not present in the weight_by_edge dictionary, the program could raise an exception when trying to set its distance to zero.

3. If there is a negative-weight cycle in the graph, the program could get stuck in an infinite loop, as it will continue to update the distances of the affected nodes without ever converging on a solution.

4. If there are duplicate

Give us such test case. Use assert.
