Yes, there is a potential bug in this program. It could occur if the "successors" attribute of a Node object contains itself, creating an infinite loop in the "extend" method call within the while loop. This would cause the program to hang and never return a result. 

For example, consider the following code snippet:

\startnode = Node()
\endnode = Node()
\startnode.successors = [startnode, endnode]

If we then call "breadth_first_search(startnode, endnode)", the program will go into an infinite loop and never return a result, as it will keep extending the queue with the startnode and never reach the endnode. 

To fix this bug, one possible solution would be to ensure that a Node object's "successors" list does not contain itself, either by manually checking for this or by implementing a check within the Node class itself.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
