There is not enough information to determine if there is a potential bug in this program. The program defines a function `topological_ordering` and a class `Node`. Without additional context, it is not clear what this program is intended to do or what inputs it is designed to handle. Additionally, there are several methods defined in the `Node` class (such as `successor`, `successors`, and `predecessors`) that are not used in the `topological_ordering` function. 

To determine if there is a bug in the program, further information is needed about the expected behavior and the possible inputs. If more information is provided, it may be possible to devise a test case that could trigger a bug.
