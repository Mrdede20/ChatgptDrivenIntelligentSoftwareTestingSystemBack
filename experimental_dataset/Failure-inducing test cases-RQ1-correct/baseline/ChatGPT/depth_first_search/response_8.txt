As this is a code for the DFS algorithm, a test case that can fail could be one where the program enters an infinite recursion loop. For example, if there is a circular dependency between nodes, meaning that a node has a successor that points to a previous node in the chain, then the algorithm will keep going back and forth between those nodes without being able to reach the goal node or finish the search. This will cause the program to enter an infinite recursion loop and eventually crash. 

Another potential test case that may trigger a bug is if the start node or the goal node are not part of the graph, meaning they were not initialized as nodes or do not have any connections to other nodes in the graph. If this happens, the algorithm will not be able to find a path between the start and goal nodes, as they are not connected to the rest of the graph, and will return a false negative result. 

It's also possible that there could be other bugs in the implementation, such as incorrect handling of empty or invalid inputs, or errors in the logic of the recursion. Therefore, comprehensive testing and input validation are necessary for ensuring the correctness and robustness of the DFS algorithm.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
