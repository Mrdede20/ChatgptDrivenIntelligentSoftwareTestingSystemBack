It is difficult to create a specific test case without knowing the full context and functionality of the program. However, some potential ways to test this code could include:
- Creating a graph with cycles, which could cause the program to get stuck in an infinite loop because it is not properly handling a scenario where the target node cannot be reached.
- Creating a graph with nodes that have multiple successors, some of which lead to the goal node and some of which do not. This could test whether the program correctly identifies the path to the goal node.
- Passing in invalid input, such as a node object that is not properly constructed according to the Node class definition. This could test whether the program is robust against unexpected inputs. 

Overall, the effectiveness of any test case will depend on the specific context and requirements of the program.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert:

node1 = Node(value=1)
node2 = Node(value=2)
node3 = Node(value=3)
node4 = Node(value=4)
node5 = Node(value=5)

# Set up the nodes' relationships
node1.successors.append(node2)
node2.successors.append(node3)
node2.successors.append(node4)
node4.successors.append(node5)

# Test case: find a path from node1 to node5
assert depth_first_search(node1, node5) == True

# Test case: find a path from node2 to node1
assert depth_first_search(node2, node1) == False

# Test case: find a path from node4 to node3
assert depth_first_search(node4, node3) == True

In this example, we create a set of nodes and connect them in a graph. We then use assert statements to test the function's ability to find paths between different nodes. The first test case should return True, as there is a path from node1 to node5 in the graph. The second test case should return False, as there is no path from node2 to node1. Finally, the third test case should return True, as there is a path from node4 to node3.
