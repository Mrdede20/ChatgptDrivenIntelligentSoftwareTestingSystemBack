As there is no specific implementation of the Node class with values for successor, successors, predecessors, incoming_nodes, and outgoing_nodes, it is difficult to provide a specific test case that would trigger a bug in the depth_first_search function. However, there are some general cases that can be considered to test the function:

1) A valid start node and goal node pair where there exists a path connecting them through the successors and predecessors of the nodes.
2) A start node and goal node pair where there is no path connecting them through the successors and predecessors of the nodes.
3) A start node and goal node pair where the start node is the same as the goal node.
4) Invalid input values such as passing None for startnode or goalnode.
5) The Node class implementation where there is a loop in the graph, i.e., a node can be accessed through its successors and predecessors in a cycle. This could lead to an infinite loop in the depth_first_search function.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
