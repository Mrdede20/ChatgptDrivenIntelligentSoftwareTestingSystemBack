Yes, there could be multiple test cases that can trigger a potential bug in the program. One possible test case that can expose a flaw is:

Scenario: Searching for a node that has a cycle in its successors

1. Create three nodes, A, B, and C.
2. Set up their connections as follows:
   - A has B as its successor
   - B has C as its successor
   - C has B as its successor (causing a cycle)
3. Call the depth_first_search function with A as the startnode and C as the goalnode.
4. The expected result is that the function should return True, indicating that the goalnode is reachable from the startnode.
5. However, if the program encounters the cycle in the successors of node B, it might loop indefinitely, resulting in a stack overflow or a memory error.

Overall, this test case can help in verifying if the function can handle nodes with cycles and avoid potential issues related to infinite loops or memory allocation.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case for depth_first_search function

# Setup
node1 = Node(value=1)
node2 = Node(value=2)
node3 = Node(value=3)
node4 = Node(value=4)

node1.successors = [node2]
node2.successors = [node3]
node3.successors = [node4]

# Test
assert depth_first_search(node1, node4) == True

# Test Case Explanation
# We set up a small graph with 4 nodes 1,2,3 and 4 such that each node only has 
# a single successor. We then search from node1 to node4 using the depth_first_search 
# function and assert that the result is True (indicating that a path exists from node1 to node4).
# Since our graph is so small and simple, there is only one path from node1 to node4.
