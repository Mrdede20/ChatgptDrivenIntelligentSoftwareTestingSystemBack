Yes, a test case that can trigger a bug in the program is if either of the input parameters, 'a' or 'b', is a negative number. The program does not handle negative numbers and will enter an infinite loop, ultimately crashing the program. 

For example, gcd(-4, 2) or gcd(4, -2) will trigger the bug in the program.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
