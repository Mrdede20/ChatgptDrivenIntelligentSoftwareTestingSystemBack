Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program above. If the inputs "a" and "b" are both 0, it will result in an infinite recursion loop and eventually cause a stack overflow error. Therefore, a test case including 0 as an input for both "a" and "b" would trigger the bug.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the `gcd` function that uses the `assert()` method:

```
def test_gcd():
    assert(gcd(16, 24) == 8)
    assert(gcd(14, 28) == 14)
    assert(gcd(0, 10) == 10)
    assert(gcd(13, 17) == 1)
    assert(gcd(40, 80) == 40)
    assert(gcd(18, 45) == 9)
    assert(gcd(30, 42) == 6)

test_gcd()
```

In this test case, we call the `gcd()` function with different input values and check if the expected output is returned by using the `assert()` method. 

For example, in the first assertion, we expect that the GCD of 16 and 24 is 8, which is the output we are checking for using the `assert()` method. If the output matches the expected result, the test passes. If not, the test fails.
