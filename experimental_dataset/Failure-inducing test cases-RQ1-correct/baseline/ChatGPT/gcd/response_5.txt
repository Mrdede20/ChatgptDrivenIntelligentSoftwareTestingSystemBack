Yes, a test case where b is negative can trigger a bug in the program. 

For example:
gcd(10, -6) 

In this case, the program will enter an infinite recursive loop, causing the program to crash eventually. 

To fix this, we can add a check for negative values of b and make it positive before calling the function recursively: 

```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    elif b < 0:
        return gcd(a, -b)
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:


Here's a test case for the gcd function, using the assert method to verify that the output matches the expected results:

assert gcd(20, 8) == 4

This test case checks that the gcd of 20 and 8 is calculated correctly, with the expected result being 4. If the output of the function is not 4, the assert method will raise an AssertionError.
