Yes, if we call the function with gcd(0,0), it will result in a division by zero error as a % b operation in line 4 will cause a ZeroDivisionError.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:


Here is a sample test case for the gcd function:

assert gcd(10, 25) == 5

This test case checks if the GCD of 10 and 25 is equal to 5. The assert statement will pass if the function returns 5, and will fail otherwise.
