There is no clear indication as to what the intended functionality of the program is, but there are certainly several logical errors and potential bugs in the code:

1. The Node class has multiple identical method names, which will likely cause issues when objects of that class are created and called upon.
2. The Node class has several empty lists as default arguments for its constructor, which could cause issues with modifying those lists later on.
3. The detect_cycle function assumes that the "successor" attribute of a given node is defined and is a valid reference to another node.
4. The detect_cycle function does not handle cyclic structures where the cycle does not include the starting node.

A potential test case that could trigger a bug in the detect_cycle function would be creating a series of nodes where node A has a successor of node B, which has a successor of node C, which has a successor of node A. Running detect_cycle on node A should return True, but the current implementation may not detect the cycle since it does not handle cyclic structures where the cycle does not include the starting node.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a sample test case using assert to test the detect_cycle function:

def test_detect_cycle():
    # create a cyclic linked list with 3 nodes
    head = Node(1)
    node_2 = Node(2)
    node_3 = Node(3)
    head.successor = node_2
    node_2.successor = node_3
    node_3.successor = head
    
    # check if cycle is detected
    assert detect_cycle(head) == True
    
    # create a linear linked list with 3 nodes
    head = Node(1)
    node_2 = Node(2)
    node_3 = Node(3)
    head.successor = node_2
    node_2.successor = node_3
    
    # check if cycle is not detected
    assert detect_cycle(head) == False
