Yes, there could be a test case which triggers a bug in the `detect_cycle` function. One possible test case could be:

```
# create nodes
n1 = Node()
n2 = Node()
n3 = Node()
n4 = Node()

# create cyclic graph
n1.successor = n2
n2.successor = n3
n3.successor = n4
n4.successor = n1

# check for cycle
assert detect_cycle(n1) == True
```

This test case creates a cyclic graph with four nodes, where the `successor` of the last node points back to the first node. When `detect_cycle` is called with the first node `n1`, it should detect the cycle and return `True`. However, if there is a bug in the function, it may not correctly detect the cycle, resulting in a failed assertion.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case using assert to check if the detect_cycle function correctly detects a cycle in a linked list:

def test_detect_cycle():
    n1 = Node(1)
    n2 = Node(2)
    n3 = Node(3)
    n4 = Node(4)
    n5 = Node(5)
    n6 = Node(6)

    n1.successor = n2
    n2.successor = n3
    n3.successor = n4
    n4.successor = n5
    n5.successor = n6
    n6.successor = n2

    assert detect_cycle(n1) == True

    n1.successor = n2
    n2.successor = n3
    n3.successor = n4
    n4.successor = n5
    n5.successor = n6

    assert detect_cycle(n1) == False

test_detect_cycle()
