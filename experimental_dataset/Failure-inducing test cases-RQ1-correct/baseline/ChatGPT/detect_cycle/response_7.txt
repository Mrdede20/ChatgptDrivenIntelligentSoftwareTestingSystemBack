Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. One possible test case is when the node has a cycle in its successors. For example:

```
# create a node with a cycle in its successors
# a -> b -> c -> d -> b
a = Node('a')
b = Node('b')
c = Node('c')
d = Node('d')
a.successor = b
b.successor = c
c.successor = d
d.successor = b

# test detect_cycle on node a
assert detect_cycle(a) == True
```

In this case, the program should detect the cycle, but it may not terminate if the `successors` list of a node contains duplicates (in this case, `b` appears twice in the list). The `detect_cycle` function uses the `is` operator to compare `hare` and `tortoise`, which only checks if they are the same object, not if they have the same value. If `successors` contains duplicates, `hare` and `tortoise` may point to different objects with the same value, so the loop may never terminate.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a possible test case for the `detect_cycle` function:

```python
def test_detect_cycle():
    # Create a cycle of four nodes
    node1 = Node(value=1)
    node2 = Node(value=2)
    node3 = Node(value=3)
    node4 = Node(value=4)
    node1.successor = node2
    node2.successor = node3
    node3.successor = node4
    node4.successor = node1

    # Test that the cycle is detected
    assert detect_cycle(node1) == True

    # Create a linear chain of four nodes
    node1 = Node(value=1)
    node2 = Node(value=2)
    node3 = Node(value=3)
    node4 = Node(value=4)
    node1.successor = node2
    node2.successor = node3
    node3.successor = node4

    # Test that the cycle is not detected
    assert detect_cycle(node1) == False
```

In this test case, we create two different linked lists: one with a cycle of four nodes, and one without a cycle. We then use `assert` statements to verify that the `detect_cycle` function returns the expected result for each input.
