Assuming that the program is intended to detect cycles in a linked list, a possible test case that could trigger a bug is when the linked list has a cycle but the "successors" attribute of some nodes is not properly updated. For example:

n1 = Node(1)
n2 = Node(2)
n3 = Node(3)
n4 = Node(4)

n1.successor = n2
n2.successor = n3
n3.successor = n4
n4.successor = n2  # create a cycle: n4 -> n2 -> n3 -> n4

# the "successors" attribute of n1, n2 and n3 is not updated 
# to reflect the new cycle, so detect_cycle(n1) should return False
assert detect_cycle(n1) == False

In this case, the program would not detect the cycle because it relies on the "successors" attribute of each node to traverse the linked list. However, if the "successors" list is not properly updated, the algorithm would not work correctly.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
