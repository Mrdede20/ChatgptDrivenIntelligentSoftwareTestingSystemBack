One potential test case could be creating a circular linked list where the last node points to one of the nodes in the middle of the list. This would cause the `detect_cycle` function to enter an infinite loop instead of returning the expected result. For example:

```
# Create a circular linked list with values 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)

node1.successor = node2
node2.successor = node3
node3.successor = node4
node4.successor = node2

# Call the detect_cycle function on the circular linked list
has_cycle = detect_cycle(node1)
print(has_cycle)  # Expected output: True
```

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case using assert:

def test_detect_cycle():
    # Test case with no cycle
    node1 = Node(1)
    node2 = Node(2)
    node3 = Node(3)
    
    node1.successor = node2
    node2.successor = node3
    
    assert detect_cycle(node1) == False
    
    # Test case with cycle
    node4 = Node(4)
    node5 = Node(5)
    
    node3.successor = node4
    node4.successor = node5
    node5.successor = node2
    
    assert detect_cycle(node1) == True
    
    # Test case with self-loop
    node6 = Node(6)
    
    node6.successor = node6
    
    assert detect_cycle(node6) == True

In this test case, we first create three nodes (1, 2, 3) with no cycle. We then set node 1 to point to node 2, and node 2 to point to node 3. We expect detect_cycle(node1) to return False because there is no cycle.

Next, we create two new nodes (4, 5) and set the successor of node 3 to node 4, the successor of node 4 to node 5, and the successor of node 5 to node 2 (creating a cycle). We expect detect_cycle(node1) to return True because there is a cycle.

Finally, we create a new node (6) with a self-loop (successor points to itself). We expect detect_cycle(node6) to return True because there is a cycle in the node itself.
