Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger a bug in the program:

1. Test case where source is longer than target:

    assert levenshtein("abcdefg", "abcde") == 2
    
    This should return 2, but the program returns 3 instead. The issue is in the first base case where the length of the target string is returned instead of the length difference between the source and target strings.

2. Test case where source and target differ in the middle:

    assert levenshtein("cat", "cut") == 1
    
    This should return 1, but the program returns 2 instead. The issue is that the program assumes that replacing a character is always better than inserting or deleting a character. In this case, replacing "a" with "u" is the correct choice, but the program chooses to delete "a" and insert "u" instead.

3. Test case where source and target are the same:

    assert levenshtein("hello", "hello") == 0
    
    This should return 0, but the program enters an infinite recursion loop because it does not have a base case for when the strings are the same. To fix this, the first base case should also handle the case where both source and target are empty strings:

    if source == '' and target == '':
        return 0
    elif source == '' or target == '':
        return len(source) or len(target)

These test cases highlight some of the limitations of the naive implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
