Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program. For example:

1. When both the source and target strings are empty, the function should return 0 instead of the length of the strings.

2. When the source string is shorter than the target string, the function may enter an infinite recursion loop. For example, calling levenshtein('abc', 'abcdef') would cause the function to keep calling itself with source = 'bc' and target = 'bcdef', resulting in a StackOverflowError.

3. When the source and target strings have different characters at the same position, the function should add 1 to the edit distance. However, if the characters are not comparable (e.g. if one of them is a number and the other is a letter), the function may return an incorrect result.

4. The function currently only handles lowercase letters. If uppercase letters or other characters are used, the function may not give accurate results.

5. There may be other edge cases where the function does not behave as expected, such as when the source and target strings contain special characters or non-ASCII characters.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
