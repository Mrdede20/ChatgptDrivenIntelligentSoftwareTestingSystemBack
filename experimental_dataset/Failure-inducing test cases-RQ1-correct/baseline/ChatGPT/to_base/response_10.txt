Yes, there are several possible test cases that could trigger a bug in the program:

1. If `num` is negative, the function will run indefinitely in the while loop. A test case with a negative `num` value should cause an error or infinite loop.

2. If `b` is less than 2 or greater than 36, the function will not work correctly because the `alphabet` list only contains 36 characters. A test case with an invalid `b` value should cause an error or incorrect output.

3. If `num` is zero, the function will return an empty string, which may not be the expected output. A test case with `num` equal to 0 should be used to verify that the output is correct.

4. If `num` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented in the given base `b`, the function will not work correctly because it will not have enough digits in the `alphabet` list. A test case with `num` greater than the maximum value for the given `b` should cause an error or incorrect output.

5. If `num` is a float or string, it will cause a TypeError. A test case with `num` as a float or string should cause a TypeError.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
