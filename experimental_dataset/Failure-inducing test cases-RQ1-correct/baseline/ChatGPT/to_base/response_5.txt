Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in this program. When the base (b) is greater than the length of the alphabet (36 characters), the program will raise an index out of range error. For example, if we call the function with num=10 and b=37, the program will raise an error because there is no 37th character in the alphabet. 

Here is an example test case that can trigger the error:

```
assert to_base(10, 37) == "A"  # This will raise an index out of range error
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1: Testing function output when num is 0

assert(to_base(0,2) == '') # Expected output: ''

# Test Case 2: Testing function output when base is 2 and num is 10

assert(to_base(10,2) == '1010') # Expected output: '1010'

# Test Case 3: Testing function output when base is 16 and num is 255

assert(to_base(255,16) == 'FF') # Expected output: 'FF'

# Test Case 4: Testing function output when base is 10 and num is 1234

assert(to_base(1234,10) == '1234') # Expected output: '1234'

# Test Case 5: Testing function output when base is 8 and num is 1234

assert(to_base(1234,8) == '2322') # Expected output: '2322'

# Test Case 6: Testing function output when base is 36 and num is 12345

assert(to_base(12345,36) == '9IX') # Expected output: '9IX'
