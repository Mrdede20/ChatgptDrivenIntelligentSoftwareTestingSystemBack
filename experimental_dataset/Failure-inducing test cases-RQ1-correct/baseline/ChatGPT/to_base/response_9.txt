Yes, there is a test case which can trigger a bug in the program. If the input argument "b" is less than or equal to 1, the program will enter an infinite loop since "num" will never become zero. Therefore, a test case with "b" equal to 0 or 1 can trigger this bug. For example:

assert to_base(10, 0) == "" # expected result: infinite loop
assert to_base(10, 1) == "" # expected result: infinite loop

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
# Test Case 1: Ensure base 2 conversion is correct
assert to_base(10, 2) == '1010'

# Test Case 2: Ensure base 8 conversion is correct
assert to_base(12345, 8) == '30071'

# Test Case 3: Ensure base 16 conversion is correct
assert to_base(255, 16) == 'FF'

# Test Case 4: Ensure base 2 conversion is correct for 0
assert to_base(0, 2) == '0'

# Test Case 5: Ensure base 10 conversion is correct for single digit number
assert to_base(6, 10) == '6'

# Test Case 6: Ensure base 36 conversion is correct for large number
assert to_base(999999, 36) == '3F1T'
