Yes, there are several potential test cases that could trigger bugs in the program above, including:

1. Testing with negative numbers:
If a negative number is passed as the first argument to the function, it will result in an infinite loop since the condition `while num > 0` would not be satisfied.

2. Testing with non-integer values:
If a non-integer value is passed as the first argument to the function, it will result in a TypeError since the `num % b` and `num // b` operations do not support non-integer types.

3. Testing with invalid base values:
If a base value less than 2 or greater than 36 is passed as the second argument to the function, it will result in an error since the `alphabet` string only includes characters for bases up to 36.

4. Testing with large values:
If the first argument to the function is a large number (e.g. 10^100), it could cause performance issues or errors due to the number of iterations required by the while loop.

5. Testing with Unicode characters:
If the first argument to the function includes Unicode characters, it could result in issues with the `alphabet` string since it only includes ASCII characters.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
