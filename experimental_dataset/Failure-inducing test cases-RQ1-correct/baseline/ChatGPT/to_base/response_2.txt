Yes, there could be several test cases that can potentially trigger a bug in the program above, such as:

- Passing a negative integer as the value of 'num' parameter could result in an infinite loop since the condition in the 'while' loop would never be met.
- Passing a base value (i.e., 'b') greater than 36 would cause an index out of range error, since the 'alphabet' variable only contains characters from string.digits and string.ascii_uppercase.
- Passing a base value less than 2 would also cause an infinite loop since the 'num // b' expression would always return 0, resulting in 'num' never reaching 0.
- Passing a non-integer value for 'num' or 'b' would result in a type error while trying to perform arithmetic operations on them.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1
assert to_base(10, 2) == '1010'

# Test Case 2
assert to_base(15, 16) == 'F'

# Test Case 3
assert to_base(123, 8) == '173'

# Test Case 4
assert to_base(0, 10) == '0'

# Test Case 5
assert to_base(27, 3) == '1000'
