Yes, if the input 'b' is less than 2 or greater than 36, the program will raise an error as there are only 36 digits and digits for any base less than 2 or greater than 36 cannot be represented using the string module. 

A possible test case would be:
- Test case 1: to_base(10, 1) - this will raise a ValueError since base cannot be less than 2.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.
