There does not appear to be a specific test case that would consistently trigger a bug in the program above. However, some possible edge cases to test include: 

1. Testing with a negative number as input for 'num'
2. Testing with a non-integer value for 'num' or 'b'
3. Testing with a large number as input for 'num' or 'b' to ensure that the function can handle large outputs 
4. Testing with a base b less than 2 or greater than 36, which are the limits of the current implementation of the alphabet variable. 

Overall, these test cases would focus on evaluating the program's ability to handle unexpected or extreme inputs and to return valid output in all cases.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1: Test if to_base() correctly converts a decimal number to binary
assert to_base(10, 2) == '1010'

# Test Case 2: Test if to_base() correctly converts a decimal number to hexadecimal
assert to_base(255, 16) == 'FF'

# Test Case 3: Test if to_base() correctly handles 0 as input
assert to_base(0, 2) == '0'

# Test Case 4: Test if to_base() correctly handles base larger than 36
assert to_base(123, 37) == '' # expected output is empty string because there is no valid digit representation for base 37

# Test Case 5: Test if to_base() correctly handles negative input
assert to_base(-10, 2) == '' # expected output is empty string because there is no valid digit representation for negative input
