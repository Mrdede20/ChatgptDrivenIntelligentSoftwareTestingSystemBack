Yes, there could be multiple test cases that could potentially trigger bugs in the above program. Some of the scenarios that could be tested are:

1. Testing with negative values of the input 'num' and 'b'. This program assumes that 'num' and 'b' are always positive integers. If negative values were to be passed, the program could get stuck in an infinite loop or return an incorrect output.

2. Testing with non-integer values of the input 'num' and 'b'. The program assumes that 'num' and 'b' are integers. If float values were to be passed, the program might throw an error or give an unexpected output.

3. Testing with a base greater than 36. In the current implementation, the program only supports bases up to 36. If a base greater than 36 is passed, the program could return an incorrect output.

4. Testing with edge cases like 'num=0' and 'num=1'. The program could potentially fail to convert 'num' to the correct base for these values.

5. Testing with large values of 'num' and 'b'. The program could run into performance issues for large numbers or bases, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
