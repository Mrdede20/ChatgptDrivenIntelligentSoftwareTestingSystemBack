Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. digit_list = [9,9,9,9]
expected output: [1,0,0,0,1]
bug: the function returns [0,0,0,0,1] instead of [1,0,0,0,1]

2. digit_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
expected output: [1,2,4,2,1]
bug: the function returns [1,2,4,1,1] instead of [1,2,4,2,1]

3. digit_list = [0,0,0,0,1]
expected output: [1,0,0,0,1]
bug: the function returns [2,0,0,0,2] instead of [1,0,0,0,1]

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:


Here's a test case using assert:

assert next_palindrome([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1]

This test case checks whether the function is correctly returning the next palindrome after the given list, which in this case is the list [1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1]. The assert statement will pass if the output of the function matches the expected output, and fail otherwise.
