Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in this program, such as:

- Inputting an empty list ([]), which would result in an IndexError when trying to access digit_list[high_mid].
- Inputting a list with only one digit ([2]), which would result in an infinite loop when high_mid and low_mid never move.
- Inputting a list where the left and right halves don't match (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), which would produce an incorrect palindrome (e.g. [1, 2, 4, 2, 1]).
- Inputting a list that is already a palindrome (e.g. [1, 2, 2, 1]), which would produce an incorrect palindrome (e.g. [1, 3, 3, 1]).
- Inputting a list where the middle digit is 9 and the two adjacent digits are not (e.g. [1, 2, 9, 4, 5]), which would produce an incorrect palindrome (e.g. [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]).

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the function next_palindrome():

def test_next_palindrome():
    assert next_palindrome([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 2]
    assert next_palindrome([9, 9, 9]) == [1, 0, 0, 1]
    assert next_palindrome([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [5, 4, 4, 5, 4]
    assert next_palindrome([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == [1, 2, 4, 2, 1]
    assert next_palindrome([1, 9, 9, 9]) == [2, 0, 0, 2]
    
test_next_palindrome() 

In the above test case, we are checking if the function next_palindrome() is returning the correct value or not by using the assert statement. Each assert statement takes an expected output and the real output from the function. If both are equal it returns nothing, otherwise, it raises an AssertionError.
