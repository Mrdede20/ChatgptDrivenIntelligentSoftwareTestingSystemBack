Yes, there are several possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. Test case where coins list is empty:
   coins = []
   total = 10
   expected output: 0
   The program should return 0 when the coins list is empty, but it will cause a runtime error due to the unpacking of an empty list in line 5. 

2. Test case where the total amount is negative:
   coins = [1, 2, 5]
   total = -5
   expected output: 0
   The program should return 0 when the total amount is negative, but it will keep subtracting coins from the total amount until it reaches a value less than zero, causing a stack overflow error.

3. Test case where the total amount is zero:
   coins = [1, 2, 5]
   total = 0
   expected output: 1
   The program should return 1 when the total amount is zero, but it does not handle this case correctly and returns the number of possible ways to make change for the total amount.

4. Test case with duplicate coins in the coins list:
   coins = [1, 2, 2, 5]
   total = 5
   expected output: 3
   The program treats duplicate coins as separate entities and considers them in the calculation of possible change, leading to an overcount of solutions. 

5. Test case with a large number of coins and a large total amount:
   coins = list(range(1, 51))
   total = 50
   expected output: > 1 billion
   The program has an exponential runtime complexity, and it will take a long time to calculate the number of possible ways to make change for a large number of coins and a large total amount.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is an example test case using assert for the possible_change function:

def test_possible_change():
\    coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]
\
\    result1 = possible_change(coins, 0)
\    assert result1 == 1, f"Error: expected 1, but got {result1}"
\
\    result2 = possible_change(coins, 17)
\    assert result2 == 6, f"Error: expected 6, but got {result2}"
\
\    result3 = possible_change(coins, -5)
\    assert result3 == 0, f"Error: expected 0, but got {result3}"
\
\    result4 = possible_change([], 10)
\    assert result4 == 0, f"Error: expected 0, but got {result4}"

In this test case, we define a list of coins [1, 5, 10, 25], and we test the function with different input arguments. We use assert statements to check if the returned results match our expected results. If a result is not what we expected, the assert statement will raise an error and print the message we defined.
