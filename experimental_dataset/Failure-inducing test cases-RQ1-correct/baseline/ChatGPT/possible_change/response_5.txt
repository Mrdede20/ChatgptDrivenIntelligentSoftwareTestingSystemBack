Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program:

1. For coins = [1, 2, 5] and total = 0, the function should return 1. This is a base case and should not generate any bugs.
2. For coins = [1, 2, 5] and total = 10, the function should return 10, as there are 10 possible ways to make change using those coins. This is a valid test case.
3. For coins = [2, 5, 10] and total = 17, the function should return 2, as there are only 2 possible ways to make change. This is also a valid test case.
4. For coins = [] and total = 10, the function should return 0, as there are no coins to use for making change. This is a test case that can trigger a bug, as the function does not handle cases where there are no coins provided properly.
5. For coins = [1, 2, 5] and total = -1, the function should return 0, as it is not possible to make change for a negative total. This is also a test case that can trigger a bug, as the function does not handle negative totals properly.

Overall, the function seems to be mostly correct, but it is missing proper handling for certain edge cases.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a possible test case for the `possible_change` function:

```
def test_possible_change():
    coins = [1, 2, 5]
    total = 10
    
    assert possible_change(coins, total) == 11
```

This test case checks if the function returns the correct number of possible ways to give change for a total of 10 using the coins [1, 2, 5]. The expected output is 11, which means there are 11 ways to give change for a total of 10 using those coins. The `assert` function checks if the function output matches the expected result.
