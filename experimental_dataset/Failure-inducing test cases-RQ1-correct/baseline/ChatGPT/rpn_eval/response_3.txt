Yes, a test case that includes division by zero could trigger a ZeroDivisionError exception in the program. For example, if the input tokens are [2.0, 0.0, '/'], the program would try to divide 2.0 by 0.0, which is impossible and would result in a ZeroDivisionError.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a sample test case for the `rpn_eval` function:

```
def test_rpn_eval():
    # Test addition
    tokens = [1.0, 2.0, '+']
    assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 3.0

    # Test subtraction
    tokens = [5.0, 3.0, '-']
    assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 2.0

    # Test multiplication
    tokens = [2.0, 3.0, '*']
    assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 6.0

    # Test division
    tokens = [6.0, 3.0, '/']
    assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 2.0
    
    # Test complex expression
    tokens = [2.0, 1.0, 3.0, '*', '+', 4.0, '-', 7.0, '/']
    assert rpn_eval(tokens) == 0.5
```

This test case checks the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as a more complex expression involving multiple operations. The `assert` statement checks if the actual result from `rpn_eval` matches the expected result, and if not, the test will fail.
