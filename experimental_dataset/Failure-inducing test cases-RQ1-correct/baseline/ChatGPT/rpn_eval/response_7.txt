One possible test case that may trigger a bug in the program is when the input tokens contain a division by zero operation. For example, the input tokens ["3", "0", "/"] would try to divide 3 by 0, which should result in a ZeroDivisionError in Python. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly, and would raise the error and terminate abruptly. To handle this case, the program could add a check for a zero denominator before executing the division operation.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case for the `rpn_eval` function using assert:

assert rpn_eval([1, 2, '+', 3, '*']) == 9.0

This test case checks if the function correctly evaluates the given reverse Polish notation expression `[1, 2, '+', 3, '*']` to be 9.0. 

We use assert to ensure that the result returned by the function is the expected value of 9.0. If the result is not equal to 9.0, assert will raise an AssertionError. This helps us to catch any errors in the function implementation and ensure that it returns the desired output.
