Yes, there are many test cases that can trigger bugs in this program. Here are some examples:

1. Division by zero: If the input tokens contain a '/' symbol with a 0 value on top of the stack, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception.

2. Insufficient operands: If the input tokens contain an operator symbol (+,-,*,/) but there are less than two operands on the stack, the program will raise an IndexError exception.

3. Unused operands: If the input tokens contain more operands than necessary, the program will ignore those operands and potentially leave them on the stack. This may cause unexpected behavior if those operands are used in subsequent calculations.

4. Incorrect precedence: If the input tokens contain a series of operations with different precedence (e.g. '2 + 3 * 4 - 5'), the program may evaluate them in the wrong order and produce an incorrect result.

5. Unsupported operators: If the input tokens contain an operator symbol that is not supported by the program (e.g. '^' for exponentiation), the program will raise a KeyError exception.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
