One possible test case that could trigger a bug in the program is if the input list of tokens contains a division by zero. For example, if the input is ["5", "0", "/"], the program will attempt to perform the division operation with operands 5 and 0, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError. The program does not check for this error condition and will crash, resulting in an unexpected behavior.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case to ensure our `rpn_eval` function is working correctly:

```
def test_rpn_eval():
    assert rpn_eval([3, 4, '+', 5, '*']) == 35.0
```

The expression `3 4 + 5 *` should evaluate to `35`, so our assertion will check if `rpn_eval` returns the correct answer. If the function works as expected, the assertion will pass.
