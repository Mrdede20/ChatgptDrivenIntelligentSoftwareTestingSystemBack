One possible test case that could trigger a bug in the program is:

rpn_eval([2, 3, '*', 1, 4, '-', '+'])

The expected result is 5, but if the program has a bug in the implementation of the '*' or '-' operators, the result might be incorrect.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case using assert to check the function rpn_eval:

def test_rpn_eval():
\    assert rpn_eval([1, 2, '+', 3, '*']) == 9
\    assert rpn_eval([3, 4, '+', 2, '*', 1, 5, '-', '/']) == 2
\    assert rpn_eval([2, 3, 4, '*', '+', 5, '/']) == 1.4

test_rpn_eval()

The first assertion computes 1 + 2 = 3, then multiplies by 3, giving 9.

The second assertion computes 3 + 4 = 7, then multiplies by 2, subtracts 1 from 5, then divides, giving 2.

The third assertion computes 3 * 4 = 12, then adds 2, then divides by 5, giving 1.4.

Assuming there are no errors in the implementation of the function, these test cases should all pass.
