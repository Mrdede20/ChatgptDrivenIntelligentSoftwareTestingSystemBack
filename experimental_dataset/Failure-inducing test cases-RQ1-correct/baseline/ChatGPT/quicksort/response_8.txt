Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program below:

1. Empty array: If an empty array is passed to the function, it will return an empty array without any sorting operation. This may not be desirable behavior in certain cases.

2. Non-integer elements: The function assumes that all elements of the input array are integers. If the array contains non-integer elements, such as strings or boolean values, it may encounter errors while comparing them.

3. Duplicate elements: The function may not handle duplicate elements correctly. If the input array contains duplicate elements, the sorting order may not be consistent or it may result in an incorrect output.

4. Large arrays: The function uses recursion to sort the array, which may result in a stack overflow error for very large arrays.

5. Performance issues: The function may not be efficient for certain types of datasets, such as arrays with many similar values or already sorted arrays. This may result in poor performance and slow execution times. 

Therefore, it is important to test the program thoroughly and consider edge cases to ensure its correctness and performance.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
