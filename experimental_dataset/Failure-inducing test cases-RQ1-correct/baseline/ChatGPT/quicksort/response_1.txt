Yes, a test case that can potentially trigger a bug in the program is when the input array contains duplicate elements. This is because the current implementation of the quicksort function does not handle duplicate elements correctly.

For example, if the input array is [3,1,2,3], the function will return [1,2,3,3]. However, the correct sorted array should be [1,2,3,3].

To fix this bug, the quicksort function needs to take into account the case where there are duplicate elements in the input array. One way to do this is to modify the "lesser" and "greater" lists to be lists of lists, where each sublist contains all elements that are equal to the pivot element. Then, these sublists can be concatenated with the lesser and greater sublists before returning the final sorted list.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test Case 1: Empty Array
assert quicksort([]) == []

# Test Case 2: Array with one element
assert quicksort([5]) == [5]

# Test Case 3: Unsorted Array
assert quicksort([9, 1, 6, 3, 7, 8]) == [1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Test Case 4: Sorted Array
assert quicksort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Test Case 5: Duplicate Values
assert quicksort([7, 5, 3, 5, 2, 8, 7]) == [2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8]
