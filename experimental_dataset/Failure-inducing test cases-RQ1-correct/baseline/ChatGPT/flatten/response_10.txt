Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger bugs in the program above:
 
1. Test case with empty list as input: flatten([]) should return an empty generator object but the program may throw an error because the loop tries to iterate over an empty list.

2. Test case with input containing non-list elements: flatten([1,2,3]) should return a generator object with 1, 2 and 3 as values but the program may throw an error because it does not check for non-list elements.

3. Test case with nested lists: flatten([[1,2],[3,[4,5]]]) should return a generator object with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as values but the program may throw an error because it does not handle nested lists properly.

4. Test case with input containing elements of different data types: flatten([[1,'a'],True,{'a':1}]) should return a generator object with 1, 'a', True, 'a' and 1 as values but the program may throw an error because it does not handle elements of different data types. 

6. Test case with input containing an infinite loop: flatten([[]]) should return an empty generator object but the program may get stuck in an infinite loop because it does not handle empty lists properly.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case

arr = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7]
res = list(flatten(arr))
expected_res = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

assert res == expected_res, f"Expected: {expected_res} but got: {res}"
