Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in this program:

1. Empty strings: If both s and t are empty strings, the program returns 0 as expected. However, if only one of them is empty, the program may encounter an IndexError since the for loop will not execute at all causing a key error in the line dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1.

2. Repeated characters: If both s and t have repeated characters, the program may fail to calculate the longest common subsequence correctly. For example, if s = 'aab' and t = 'ab', the program would return 1 instead of 2. 

3. Different lengths: If s and t have different lengths, the program may encounter an IndexError since the indexing in the line dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1 may exceed the range of the shorter string.

4. Non-string inputs: If either s or t is not a string, the program will not execute correctly since it is designed to work with only strings.

These scenarios can be tested to check if the program works correctly and if any bugs exist.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the lcs_length function:

assert lcs_length("ABCDGH", "AEDFHR") == 3

This test case checks if the function correctly returns the length of the Longest Common Subsequence between the two strings "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR", which is "ADH" and has a length of 3.
