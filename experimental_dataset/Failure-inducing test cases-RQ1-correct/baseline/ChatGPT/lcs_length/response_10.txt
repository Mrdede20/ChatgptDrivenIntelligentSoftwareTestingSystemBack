Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the above program. Here are a few examples:

1. Case where the two input strings are empty strings:

```python
s = ''
t = ''
assert lcs_length(s, t) == 0
```

2. Case where the two input strings are completely different:

```python
s = 'hello'
t = 'world'
assert lcs_length(s, t) == 0
```

3. Case where one input string is a permutation of the other:

```python
s = 'abcd'
t = 'badc'
assert lcs_length(s, t) == 2
```

4. Case where one input string is a substring of the other:

```python
s = 'hello'
t = 'hell'
assert lcs_length(s, t) == 4
```

5. Case where the two input strings have overlapping characters but no common subsequences:

```python
s = 'abcde'
t = 'defgh'
assert lcs_length(s, t) == 0
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the `lcs_length` function using the `assert` statement:

```python
s = 'ABCBDAB'
t = 'BDCABA'
result = lcs_length(s, t)
assert result == 4, f"Expected 4 but got {result}"
```

This test case checks whether the LCS length of `s` and `t` is computed correctly - we expect the function to return `4`, as the longest common subsequence between `s` and `t` is 'BDAB'. If the returned result is not equal to `4`, the `assert` statement will fail and raise an assertion error, indicating that the function is not working correctly.
