Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program above.

One possible scenario for triggering a bug is when both input strings are empty or have length 1. In this case, the program would return 0, which is incorrect. 

For example, if we call the function with s = "" and t = "", the expected output should be 0 (as there is no common subsequence), but the program would return 1 (as the max value of an empty Counter is 1). 

To fix this bug, we can add an if statement at the beginning of the function to check for the cases when s or t are empty, and return 0 in those cases. 

Here's the modified code:

```
def lcs_length(s, t):
    if not s or not t:
        return 0
    from collections import Counter

    dp = Counter()

    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1

    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
```

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case for the above function using assert:

assert lcs_length("abcd", "bcd") == 3

This test case checks if the length of the longest common subsequence between "abcd" and "bcd" is 3. If the function returns the correct output, the assert statement will pass silently. If the output is incorrect, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError.
