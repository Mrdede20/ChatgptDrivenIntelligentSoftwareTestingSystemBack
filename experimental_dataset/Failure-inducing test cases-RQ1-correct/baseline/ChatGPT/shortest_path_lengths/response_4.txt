Yes, there are test cases that can trigger bugs in this program. Here are some examples:

1. If the input "n" is negative or zero, the program should return an error message instead of running the calculation. This case is not handled in the current implementation.
2. If the input "length_by_edge" contains a negative value, the program will not work correctly, because it assumes all values are positive. This case should be handled by either throwing an error message or converting negative values to positive ones.
3. If the input "length_by_edge" is an empty dictionary, the program should return a dictionary with all values set to infinity. This case is not handled in the current implementation.
4. If the input "length_by_edge" contains two or more paths with the same source and destination nodes, the program may not return the shortest path for one of them. This can happen because the program updates the dictionary with the last shortest path found, which may not be the ones found first. This case can be tested by providing an input with multiple paths for the same source and destination nodes, and checking if the output is correct for all of them.
5. If the input "length_by_edge" contains a path that goes through a negative cycle, the program will not be able to find the shortest path correctly. This case can be tested by providing an input with a negative cycle, and checking if the output is correct.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
