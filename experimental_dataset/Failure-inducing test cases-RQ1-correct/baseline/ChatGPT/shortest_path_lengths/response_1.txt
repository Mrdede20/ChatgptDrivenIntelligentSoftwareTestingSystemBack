Yes, there are several possible test cases that could potentially trigger bugs in the program. 

One possible test case involves a negative cycle in the graph. A negative cycle is a cycle of edges whose total weight is negative. The Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is used in the program, can detect negative cycles and return an error. However, the current implementation does not check for negative cycles, and may return incorrect shortest path lengths if there is a negative cycle present.

Here's an example test case that includes a negative cycle:

```
# Graph with negative cycle
n = 4
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (0, 2): 5,
    (1, 2): 2,
    (2, 3): 3,
    (3, 1): -6  # negative cycle
}
shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge)
```

In this test case, there is a negative cycle in the graph involving the edges (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1). The correct behavior would be for the program to detect the negative cycle and return an error message. However, the current implementation would continue to run and return incorrect shortest path lengths.

Another possible test case involves disconnected graphs. The current implementation assumes that the graph is connected, meaning that there is a path between every pair of nodes. However, if the graph is disconnected, the program may return incorrect shortest path lengths.

Here's an example test case that involves a disconnected graph:

```
# Disconnected graph
n = 6
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (1, 2): 2,
    (3, 4): 3,
    (4, 5): 4
}
shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge)
```

In this test case, the graph is divided into two disconnected components: nodes 0-2 and nodes 3-5. The correct behavior would be for the program to return infinite path lengths for pairs of nodes that cannot be reached from each other. However, the current implementation would return shortest path lengths even for disconnected pairs of nodes, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
