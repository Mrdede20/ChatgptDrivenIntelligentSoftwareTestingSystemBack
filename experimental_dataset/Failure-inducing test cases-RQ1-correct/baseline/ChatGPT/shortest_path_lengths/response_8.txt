Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger bugs in the program. Some possible test cases are:

1. When n is 0 or 1, the program will not work correctly, as it assumes that there are at least two nodes in the graph.

2. When there are negative cycles in the graph, the program will not terminate correctly, as it tries to update the shortest path lengths infinitely. A test case that triggers this bug could be a graph with three nodes and edges (0, 1, -1), (1, 2, -1), and (2, 0, -1).

3. When there are disconnected nodes in the graph, the program will return infinity as the shortest path length between them. A test case that triggers this bug could be a graph with two nodes and no edges.

4. When there are multiple paths with the same length between two nodes, the program will return only one of them. A test case that triggers this bug could be a graph with three nodes and edges (0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), and (0, 2, 2).

5. When the input data is not properly formatted (for example, when the length_by_edge is not a dictionary), the program will raise a TypeError or a KeyError. A test case that triggers this bug could be passing a list instead of a dictionary as the length_by_edge argument.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert:

# Test case
edges = {
    (0, 1): 5,
    (1, 2): 3,
    (0, 3): 6,
    (3, 2): 2,
    (2, 4): 6,
    (3, 4): 4
}
n = 5

# Expected shortest path lengths
expected_lengths = {
    (0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 5, (0, 2): 8, (0, 3): 6, (0, 4): 10,
    (1, 0): float('inf'), (1, 1): 0, (1, 2): 3, (1, 3): float('inf'), (1, 4): float('inf'),
    (2, 0): float('inf'), (2, 1): float('inf'), (2, 2): 0, (2, 3): float('inf'), (2, 4): 6,
    (3, 0): float('inf'), (3, 1): float('inf'), (3, 2): 2, (3, 3): 0, (3, 4): 4,
    (4, 0): float('inf'), (4, 1): float('inf'), (4, 2): float('inf'), (4, 3): float('inf'), (4, 4): 0
}

assert shortest_path_lengths(n, edges) == expected_lengths

This test case checks if the function shortest_path_lengths returns the expected shortest path lengths for a given set of edges and number of vertices. The assert statement compares the actual output of the function with the expected output and raises an exception if they do not match.
