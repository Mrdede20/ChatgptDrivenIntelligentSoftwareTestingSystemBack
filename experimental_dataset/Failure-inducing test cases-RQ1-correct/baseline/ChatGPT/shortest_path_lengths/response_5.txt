Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program above. Here are a few examples:

1. Test case with negative weights: If there exists at least one negative weight edge in the input graph, the program may enter an infinite loop since the path lengths between two nodes can decrease indefinitely with negative weight cycles. Therefore, testing the program with a graph that contains negative weights would be a good test case.

2. Test case with disconnected graph: The program assumes that the input graph is connected, meaning that there exists a path between any two nodes. However, if the input graph is disconnected, the program may not compute the shortest paths correctly since it only considers the paths within the connected component of the starting node. Therefore, testing the program with a disconnected graph would be a good test case.

3. Test case with large input sizes: The program has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of nodes in the input graph. Therefore, testing the program with large input sizes could help identify performance issues or potential bugs related to memory usage.

4. Test case with invalid input: The program assumes that the input is a dictionary with tuples of two integers as keys and float values as values. Testing the program with invalid input, such as a list or a dictionary with keys that are not tuples of two integers, could help identify bugs related to input validation.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
