Yes, there are several possible test cases that can trigger bugs in this program. Here are some examples:

1. Testing the case where there is a negative cycle in the graph. The program may not handle this case properly, leading to incorrect results or even an infinite loop. One possible input for this case is:

n = 4
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (1, 2): -3,
    (2, 3): 2,
    (3, 0): 1
}

2. Testing the case where some nodes are not reachable from others. The program may return incorrect results for these nodes, since they will have a distance of infinity by default. One possible input for this case is:

n = 5
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 2,
    (1, 2): 1,
    (2, 3): 3,
    (3, 4): 1
}

3. Testing the case where there are multiple shortest paths between two nodes. The program may not handle this case properly, since it only keeps track of the shortest path length, but not the actual paths themselves. One possible input for this case is:

n = 4
length_by_edge = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (1, 2): 2,
    (2, 3): 1,
    (0, 3): 3
}

In this case, there are two possible shortest paths from node 0 to node 3: either (0, 1, 2, 3) or (0, 3), both with a length of 3. The program may return only one of these paths, or it may not handle the case properly and return incorrect results.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
