Yes, there are several test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in this program. Here are a few examples:

1. Edge case: n = 0
This test case would check if the program can handle the scenario where there are no nodes in the graph.

2. Edge case: n = 1
This test case would check if the program can handle the scenario where there is only one node in the graph.

3. Edge case: n = 2 and length_by_edge has a cycle
This test case would check if the program can handle graphs with cycles. For example, if we set n = 2 and length_by_edge = {(0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2} then there is a cycle in the graph that the program needs to handle.

4. Randomly generated test cases
We could also generate random graphs and test if the output of the program matches the expected output. We could vary the size of the graph and the density of the edges to test different scenarios.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case using assert to verify the functionality of the shortest_path_lengths function:

def test_shortest_path_lengths():
    n = 4
    length_by_edge = {(0, 1): 1, (1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 3, (3, 0): 4}
    result = shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge)
    assert result[(0, 3)] == 4
    assert result[(1, 3)] == 5
    assert result[(2, 0)] == float('inf')
    assert result[(1, 1)] == 0

test_shortest_path_lengths()

In this test case, we're testing the shortest_path_lengths function with a graph containing 4 vertices and 4 edges. We're asserting that the shortest path length between certain vertices is what we expect it to be, and we're also testing that the function returns infinity for vertices that are not connected by an edge. Finally, we also test that the shortest path length between a vertex and itself is 0.
