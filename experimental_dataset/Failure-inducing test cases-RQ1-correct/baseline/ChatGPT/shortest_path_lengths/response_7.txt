Yes, there are definitely test cases that can trigger bugs in this program. Here are some examples:

1. Test case where n=0 (i.e. there are no nodes). This could potentially cause errors when the program tries to access length_by_edge or length_by_path, since these data structures are initialized assuming n>0.

2. Test case where length_by_edge contains a negative edge weight. This could cause the program to get stuck in an infinite loop, since the Floyd-Warshall algorithm assumes that all edge weights are non-negative.

3. Test case where length_by_edge contains a cycle with negative weight. This could cause the program to return incorrect shortest path lengths, since the Floyd-Warshall algorithm assumes that there are no negative cycles in the graph.

4. Test case where length_by_edge contains multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. This could cause the program to return incorrect shortest path lengths, since it doesn't handle multiple edges properly.

5. Test case where length_by_edge contains an edge between a non-existent node and a valid node. This could cause the program to raise a KeyError or return incorrect shortest path lengths, depending on how the defaultdict is set up.

6. Test case where length_by_edge is not a dictionary. This could cause the program to raise a TypeError, since it assumes that length_by_edge is a dictionary.

These are just a few examples - there may be many other ways to trigger bugs depending on the specifics of the input data. It would be a good idea to thoroughly test the program with a variety of different inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

# Test case

# Let's test the function on a small graph
# with four nodes and five edges

graph = {
    (0, 1): 1,
    (1, 2): 2,
    (2, 3): 3,
    (3, 0): 4,
    (0, 2): 2
}

assert shortest_path_lengths(4, graph)[(0, 3)] == 6

# Explanation:
# There are two paths to get from node 0 to node 3:
# 1. 0 -> 2 -> 3: length is 2 + 3 = 5
# 2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3: length is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
# The second path is longer, so the function correctly returns 6 as the shortest path length.
