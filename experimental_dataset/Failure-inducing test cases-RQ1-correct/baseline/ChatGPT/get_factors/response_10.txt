Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above.

1. Inputting n = 1 may cause the program to return an empty list when it should return a list containing the factor 1.
2. Inputting n = 4 may cause the program to return a list containing only one factor, 2, when it should return [2, 2].
3. Inputting n = 15 may cause the program to return a list containing only one factor, 3, when it should return [3, 5].
4. Inputting n = 25 may cause the program to return a list containing only one factor, 5, when it should return [5, 5].
5. Inputting n = 29 may cause the program to return a list containing only one factor, 29, when it should return [29].

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
# Test case 1
assert get_factors(12) == [2, 2, 3]

# Test case 2
assert get_factors(20) == [2, 2, 5]

# Test case 3
assert get_factors(125) == [5, 5, 5]

# Test case 4
assert get_factors(1) == []
