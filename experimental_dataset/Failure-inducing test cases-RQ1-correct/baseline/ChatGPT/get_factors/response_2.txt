Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. Here are a few examples:

1. Test case with small prime number:

Input: n = 13
Output: [13]

Expected Output: []
Explanation: As 13 is a prime number, it should return an empty list as it doesn't have any factors.

2. Test case with repeated factors:

Input: n = 12
Output: [2, 2, 3]

Expected Output: [2, 2, 3]
Explanation: As 12 can be factored as 2 * 2 * 3, the program is expected to return [2, 2, 3] but it only returns [2, 6]. This is because after dividing 12 by 2 (to get 6), it doesn't test if 6 is also divisible by 2.

3. Test case with a large number:

Input: n = 1234567890
Output: [2, 3, 5, 3607, 3803]

Expected Output: [2, 3, 3, 3607, 3803]
Explanation: The program correctly factors 1234567890 as 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 3607 * 3803, but it returns [2, 3, 5, 3607, 3803] instead of [2, 3, 3, 3607, 3803]. This is because it doesn't handle repeated factors correctly.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

response@ChatGPT:
Here's a test case for this function:

def test_get_factors():
\    assert get_factors(1) == []
\    assert get_factors(2) == [2]
\    assert get_factors(4) == [2, 2]
\    assert get_factors(27) == [3, 3, 3]
\    assert get_factors(28) == [2, 2, 7]
\    assert get_factors(100) == [2, 2, 5, 5]
\
\test_get_factors()

This tests the edge case of 1, as well as various other numbers to ensure that the function correctly returns their prime factors.
