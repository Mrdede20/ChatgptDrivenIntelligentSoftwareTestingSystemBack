Yes, there are many test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above. Here are a few examples:

1. Test case: n = 1
Expected output: []
Actual output: []

2. Test case: n = 2
Expected output: [2]
Actual output: [2]

3. Test case: n = 100
Expected output: [2, 2, 5, 5]
Actual output: [2, 2, 5]

4. Test case: n = 17
Expected output: [17]
Actual output: [17]

5. Test case: n = 0
Expected output: Error (division by zero)
Actual output: Error (division by zero)

6. Test case: n = -10
Expected output: Error (negative numbers are not allowed)
Actual output: Error (negative numbers are not allowed)

These test cases can help identify bugs such as incorrect output, infinite loops, or runtime errors in the program.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the function `get_factors` using `assert`:

```
# Test case
assert get_factors(1) == []
assert get_factors(10) == [2, 5]
assert get_factors(25) == [5, 5]
assert get_factors(60) == [2, 2, 3, 5]
assert get_factors(13195) == [5, 7, 13, 29]
```

This test case checks if the `get_factors` function returns the expected factors for different input values. Each assertion checks if the result of calling the function with a specific argument is equal to the expected list of factors. If any of the assertions fails, it will raise an `AssertionError` indicating the values that were not equal.
