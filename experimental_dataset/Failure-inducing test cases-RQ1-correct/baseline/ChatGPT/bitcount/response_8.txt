Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. The program is designed to count the number of 1 bits in a binary representation of a number. However, if the input is a negative number, the program may enter an infinite loop and fail to return the correct result.  

For example, if the input is -5, the program may enter an infinite loop because the bitwise AND operation with (n - 1) will never be equal to zero. To avoid this issue, the program should include a check for negative numbers and handle them appropriately. 

Therefore, a test case that can trigger a bug in the program is:

assert(bitcount(-5)) # Expected output: An error or infinite loop

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the bitcount function using Python's assert statement:

assert bitcount(0) == 0 # zero bits
assert bitcount(7) == 3 # three bits
assert bitcount(64) == 1 # one bit
assert bitcount(1023) == 10 # ten bits

This code tests four cases of the bitcount function by calling it with various input values and comparing the returned results to expected outcomes. The assert statement will raise an AssertionError if any of the tests fail. If all of the tests pass, the program will exit silently.
