Yes, there are many possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the mergesort function. Here are some examples:

1. Testing with an empty array: If we pass an empty array to the mergesort function, it should return the same empty array without any sorting. If this doesn't happen, it's a bug.

2. Testing with an array containing only one element: If we pass an array with just one element to the mergesort function, it should return the same array without any sorting. If this doesn't happen, it's a bug.

3. Testing with an array containing duplicate elements: If we pass an array with duplicate elements to the mergesort function, it should sort them correctly without changing the number of duplicates. If this doesn't happen, it's a bug.

4. Testing with a large array: If we pass a large array to the mergesort function, it should sort it correctly without crashing or taking an unreasonable amount of time. If either of these happens, it's a bug.

5. Testing with an array containing negative numbers: If we pass an array with negative numbers to the mergesort function, it should sort them correctly without changing their order or sign. If this doesn't happen, it's a bug.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more possible test cases depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the program. The goal of testing is to identify and isolate as many bugs as possible, so the more diverse and comprehensive the test cases, the better.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
