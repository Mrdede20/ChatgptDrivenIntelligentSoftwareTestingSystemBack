Yes, there could be test cases that trigger bugs in this program. Here are a few examples:
- If the input array contains elements with duplicate values, the sorting order of these elements may not be preserved properly after the merge step.
- If the input array contains very large or very small numbers, the program may encounter issues related to integer overflow or underflow.
- If the input array is very large, the program may encounter performance issues due to memory constraints or excessive recursion.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a test case for the mergesort function:

def test_mergesort():
\    arr1 = [4, 2, 6, 1, 8, 5, 3, 7]
\    arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
\    arr3 = [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    
\    assert mergesort(arr1) == arr2
\    assert mergesort(arr2) == arr2
\    assert mergesort(arr3) == arr2

This test case tests the function with three different input arrays, one unsorted, one already sorted, and one in reverse order. It then asserts that the output of the function is equal to the expected sorted array for each input.
