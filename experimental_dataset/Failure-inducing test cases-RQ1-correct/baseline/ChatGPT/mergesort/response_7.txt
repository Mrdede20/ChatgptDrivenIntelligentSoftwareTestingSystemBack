Yes, there are multiple test cases which can potentially trigger a bug in the program:

1. Test case where the input array contains duplicate elements
- This could potentially cause issues with the merge function as it may not properly handle cases where there are duplicate elements in the left and right sub-arrays.

2. Test case where the input array contains negative numbers
- This could potentially cause issues with the comparison operation in the merge function as it may not properly handle cases where there are negative numbers in the array.

3. Test case where the input array is already sorted
- This could potentially cause issues with the merge and sorting algorithms as it may not properly handle cases where the input array is already sorted.

4. Test case where the input array is empty
- This could potentially cause issues with the length check in the mergesort function as it may not properly handle cases where the input array is empty.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's a sample test case for the mergesort function:

```python
assert mergesort([3, 2, 1, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This tests that the function correctly sorts the input list in ascending order. The assert statement will raise an AssertionError if the expected output (the sorted list) doesn't match the actual output of the function.
