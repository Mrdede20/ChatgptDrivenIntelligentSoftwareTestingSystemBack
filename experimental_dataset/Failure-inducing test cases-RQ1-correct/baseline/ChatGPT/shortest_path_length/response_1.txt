There isn't enough context to determine the exact purpose and behavior of this code. It looks like a Python implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using a priority queue, and it defines a Node class for building a graph. Without a specific use case or input data, it's difficult to devise a test case to trigger a bug.

However, some potential issues could arise if the input data is malformed or inconsistent, such as:

- If the length_by_edge dictionary is missing an entry for an existing edge, it will raise a KeyError when trying to access it.
- If the startnode or goalnode are not in the graph, it will raise an AttributeError when trying to access their successor array.
- If the successor arrays contain references to nodes that are not part of the graph, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during the traversal.
- If the distance between two nodes is negative, it could cause the algorithm to loop indefinitely or produce incorrect results.

To create a test case, one could generate a random graph with different sizes and connectivity patterns, populate it with weights for each edge, and verify that the algorithm returns the expected shortest path between two nodes. Alternatively, one could create a deliberate edge case scenario where one of the input parameters is malformed or invalid and confirm that the code handles it gracefully.

Give us such test case. Use assert.
