Unfortunately, I cannot fully answer this question without additional information. The program code provided above has several undefined variables and functions such as "length_by_edge" and "node_heap" that are not defined in the given code. Without knowing the functionality of these variables, it is impossible to determine whether there is any test case that can trigger a bug in the program.
