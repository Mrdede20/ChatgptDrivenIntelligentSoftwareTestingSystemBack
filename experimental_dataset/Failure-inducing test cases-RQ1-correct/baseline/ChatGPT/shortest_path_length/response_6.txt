Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether there is a bug in this program without more context on what it is supposed to do and its intended behavior. 

However, some potential issues in the code are:

1. The Node class seems to have two conflicting methods with the same name, `successor`. One returns a single successor node while the other returns a list of successor nodes. Depending on what is expected, this may cause unexpected behavior.

2. The `get` function in the `shortest_path_length` method returns 0 if the wanted node is not found in the node heap. However, this may cause an issue if there is a node with a distance of 0, leading to incorrect calculations of the minimal distance.

3. The `insert_or_update` function assumes that each node is unique and can only appear once in the node heap. If this is not the case, the function may not update the correct node, leading to incorrect results.

Without more information and specific test cases, it is difficult to tell whether these potential issues will cause bugs in the program.

request@user:
Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case using assert:

# Test shortest_path_length function with a graph of 5 nodes and 6 edges
n1 = Node()
n2 = Node()
n3 = Node()
n4 = Node()
n5 = Node()

n1.successors = [n2, n3]
n2.successors = [n3, n4]
n3.successors = [n4, n5]
n4.successors = [n5]

length_by_edge = {
    (n1, n2): 5,
    (n1, n3): 3,
    (n2, n3): 4,
    (n2, n4): 6,
    (n3, n4): 2,
    (n3, n5): 7,
    (n4, n5): 1
}

assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, n1, n5) == 9

# The shortest path from n1 to n5 is [n1, n3, n4, n5] with a length of 9

assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, n2, n5) == 6

# The shortest path from n2 to n5 is [n2, n4, n5] with a length of 6
