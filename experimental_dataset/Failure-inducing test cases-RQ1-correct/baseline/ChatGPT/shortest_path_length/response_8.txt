It is difficult to determine if there is a specific test case that could trigger a bug in this program without more information on the input and expected output. 

However, some potential issues that could result in bugs include:

- Incorrect use of variables or functions (e.g. using "successor" instead of "successors" as a variable name)
- Incorrect or inconsistent variable types (e.g. using a list for "successor" but a single value for "incoming_nodes")
- Missing or incorrect logic in the "insert_or_update" function
- Missing or incorrect handling of edge cases such as nodes with no successors or unreachable goal nodes. 

A comprehensive set of test cases should cover a variety of input types, including empty and non-empty graphs, connected and disconnected graphs, and graphs with cycles or multiple shortest paths between nodes.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here is a test case for the shortest_path_length function:

```
def test_shortest_path_length():
    node1 = Node(value=1)
    node2 = Node(value=2)
    node3 = Node(value=3)
    node4 = Node(value=4)
    node5 = Node(value=5)
    
    node1.successors = [(node2, 1), (node3, 3)]
    node2.successors = [(node3, 1), (node4, 1)]
    node3.successors = [(node4, 1)]
    node4.successors = []
    node5.successors = [(node2, 1), (node3, 1)]
    
    assert shortest_path_length({(node1, node2): 1, (node1, node3): 3, (node2, node3): 1, (node2, node4): 1, (node3, node4): 1}, node1, node4) == 2
    assert shortest_path_length({(node1, node2): 1, (node1, node3): 3, (node2, node3): 1, (node2, node4): 1, (node3, node4): 1}, node1, node5) == float('inf')
```

In this test case, we create a directed graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges. We then calculate the shortest path length from node 1 to node 4 and from node 1 to node 5. We assert that the correct shortest path lengths are returned. The first test case should pass, since the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is of length 2. The second test case should also pass, since there is no path from node 1 to node 5.
