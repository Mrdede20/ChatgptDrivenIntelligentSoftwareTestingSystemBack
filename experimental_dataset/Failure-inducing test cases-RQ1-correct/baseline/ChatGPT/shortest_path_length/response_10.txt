Without further context to the program and its intended usage, it is difficult to determine a specific test case that would trigger a bug. However, some potential areas for testing include:

- Testing for correctness of shortest path calculation: generate a graph with known shortest paths between nodes and test if the program returns the expected shortest path length between specific nodes.
- Testing handling of invalid input: for example, passing in a start or goal node that does not exist in the graph or passing in invalid input for the length_by_edge dictionary.
- Testing performance: generate a large graph and test if the program can efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes.

Additionally, the function could potentially have bugs related to using the `insert_or_update` function, which updates the distance of an already visited node in the `unvisited_nodes` heap. Therefore, testing for the handling of visited nodes and the correctness of the `insert_or_update` function could also be a potential test case.

Give us such test case. Use assert.

Here's an example test case for the `shortest_path_length` function:

```
def test_shortest_path_length():
    # Setup
    node1 = Node()
    node2 = Node()
    node3 = Node()
    node4 = Node()

    node1.successors = [node2, node3]
    node2.successors = [node4]
    node3.successors = [node4]
    node4.successors = []

    length_by_edge = {
        (node1, node2): 2,
        (node1, node3): 4,
        (node2, node4): 3,
        (node3, node4): 1,
    }

    # Assertions
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, node1, node4) == 5
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, node1, node3) == 4
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, node2, node4) == 3
    assert shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, node4, node1) == float('inf')
```

This test case sets up a simple graph with nodes and edges, and tests several different scenarios with known shortest path lengths. The `assert` statements ensure that the function returns the expected lengths for each scenario.
