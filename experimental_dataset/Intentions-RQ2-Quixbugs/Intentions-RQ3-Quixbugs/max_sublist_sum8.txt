The intention of the code is to find the maximum sum of any contiguous sublist in an input list of integers. The algorithm iterates through each element of the input list and maintains two variables: `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`. `max_ending_here` represents the maximum sum of a sublist that ends at the current element, while `max_so_far` represents the maximum sum of any sublist seen so far. The algorithm updates both variables with each iteration of the loop until it has processed the entire list, and returns `max_so_far` as the final result. This is an efficient algorithm to solve the maximum sublist sum problem with a time complexity of O(n).
