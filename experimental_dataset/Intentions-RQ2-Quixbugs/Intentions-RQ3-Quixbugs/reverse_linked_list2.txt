The intention of this code is to reverse a given singly-linked list by manipulating its successor pointers. The input is the head of the linked list, and the function iterates through each node, reassigning its successor pointer to the previous node, and updating the previous node pointer to the current node. At the end of iteration, the function returns the new head of the reversed linked list. This function mutates the original linked list by modifying the successor pointers of each node, and the precondition is that the linked list is acyclic, meaning it does not contain any cycles or loops.
