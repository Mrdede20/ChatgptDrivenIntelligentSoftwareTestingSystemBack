The intention of the given code is to detect whether a linked list has a cycle or not. The algorithm used to accomplish this is called Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm or the "tortoise and hare" algorithm. 

The algorithm works by using two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other. If there is a cycle in the linked list, eventually the fast-moving pointer, known as the hare, will meet with the slow-moving pointer, known as the tortoise. 

If there is no cycle, the hare will eventually reach the end of the linked list, so we can return False. Otherwise, if the hare and tortoise pointers meet, there is a cycle and we return True.
