The code above implements a K-Heapsort, an almost-sorted array, wherein every element is no more than k units from its sorted position, sorted in O(n log k) time.

The input of the function is an array of ints and k, indicating the maximum displacement of an element in arr from its final sorted position.

The function takes the first k elements of the array and heapify them, then iterates through the array, pushing each element onto the heap and yielding the smallest one, ensuring that only k elements are in the heap at any given time. Finally, it yields the remaining elements of the heap in their proper order.

The output of the function is a generator that yields the elements of arr in sorted order.

Some examples are given in the code above. If the array is already sorted, the value of k can be set to 0, and the function will yield the original array, sorted.
