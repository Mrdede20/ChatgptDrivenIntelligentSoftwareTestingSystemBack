The intention of the code is to provide a function `to_base` that takes in two arguments `num` and `b`, where `num` is a base-10 integer and `b` is the target base to convert it to. The function will convert the given `num` to the target base `b` using string representations of digits and letters as specified in the `alphabet` variable. The function performs the conversion by dividing the `num` by the target base `b` and finding the remainder of each division operation. The remainder is then used to index into the `alphabet` variable to retrieve the corresponding character. This process is repeated until `num` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the resulting string representing the value of `num` in the target base `b`.
