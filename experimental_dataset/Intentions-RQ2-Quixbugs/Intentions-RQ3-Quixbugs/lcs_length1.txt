The intention of the code is to find the length of the longest common substring shared between two strings, s and t. The code uses a dyamic programming approach to find the length of the longest common substring by computing the length of the longest common suffix obtained by checking the current character of each string, and then comparing it to the length of the longest common suffix obtained by excluding either s[i] or t[j]. Finally, the function returns the maximum value of the dictionary of calculated values of the longest common substring of s and t.
