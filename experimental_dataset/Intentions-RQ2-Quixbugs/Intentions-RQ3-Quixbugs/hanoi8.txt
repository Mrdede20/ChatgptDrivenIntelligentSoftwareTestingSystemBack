This code defines a function `hanoi` that solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The puzzle involves moving a stack of differently-sized disks from one peg to another, using a third peg as an intermediary. The function takes in the height of the stack of disks, as well as the starting and ending pegs (which are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, if not provided). The function returns a list of pairs representing the moves required to solve the puzzle. 

The function works recursively, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems by moving progressively smaller stacks of disks to the helper peg, before ultimately moving the bottom disk to the desired peg. The function returns an ordered list of pairs representing the moves required to solve the problem, with each pair indicating a move from one peg to another.
