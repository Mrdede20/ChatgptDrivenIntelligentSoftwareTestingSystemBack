The above code is an implementation of Floyd-Warshall algorithm, a graph algorithm that calculates the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. 

The function `shortest_path_lengths` takes two input arguments: `n` is the number of nodes in the graph and `length_by_edge` is a dictionary containing edge length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. 

The algorithm initializes a dictionary to store the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in the graph. It then updates this dictionary with the edge lengths provided in the `length_by_edge` input.

The algorithm then iteratively updates the shortest path lengths using dynamic programming. At each iteration, it tries to find the shortest path from node `i` to node `j` by checking if the shortest path found so far from node `i` to node `j` can be improved by routing through node `k`. If a shorter path is found, it is used to update the value in the dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the updated dictionary containing the shortest path length between every ordered pair of nodes in the input graph.
