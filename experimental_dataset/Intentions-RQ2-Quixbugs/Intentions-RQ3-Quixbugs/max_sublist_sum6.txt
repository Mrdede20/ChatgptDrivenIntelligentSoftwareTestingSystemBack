The intention of the given code is to find the maximum sum of contiguous sublists in a given list of integers (arr) using an efficient algorithm. The algorithm used is called Kadane's algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n). The max_sublist_sum() function takes the list of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous sublist of the list. The code also includes a docstring that explains the functionality of the function, an example input, and the expected output.
