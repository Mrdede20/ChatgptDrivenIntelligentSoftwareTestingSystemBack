The code is implementing the tortoise-and-hare algorithm to detect a cycle in a linked list. The algorithm uses two pointers - a slow pointer (tortoise) and a fast pointer (hare) - to traverse the linked list. They both start at the head of the linked list, and the hare moves two steps at a time while the tortoise moves one. If there is no cycle, then the hare will eventually reach the end of the linked list. However, if there is a cycle, the hare will eventually catch up to the tortoise and both pointers will be pointing to the same node. 

The code keeps running the while loop until either the hare reaches the end of the linked list or the hare catches up to the tortoise. If the hare reaches the end of the linked list without finding a cycle, the function returns `False`. On the other hand, if the hare and tortoise pointers are pointing to the same node, it means there is a cycle in the linked list and the function returns `True`.
