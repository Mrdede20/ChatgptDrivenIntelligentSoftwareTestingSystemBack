The intention of the code is to calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings, which is the minimum number of single-character edits required to transform one string into another. The function takes two string inputs, source and target, and returns the Levenshtein distance between them. 

The code recursively calculates the Levenshtein distance by breaking down the comparison into smaller substrings. If the first characters of both strings are the same, the function recursively calls itself with the first character of both strings removed. If the first characters are different, the function recursively calls itself with three options: removing the first character of the target string, removing the first character of the source string, or changing the first character of the source string to match the first character of the target string. The final result is the minimum of these three options plus one.
