The intention of the code is to generate all possible subsets of a given list (power set) without duplicates, including the empty set and the original set itself. The function ‘powerset()’ takes a list ‘arr’ as input and returns a list of lists, representing all possible subsets of ‘arr’. The algorithm recursively divides the input list into two parts, where the first part is a single element ‘first’ and the second part is the remaining list ‘rest’. It then recursively generates all possible subsets of ‘rest’ and combines them with the ‘first’ element in all possible ways. The base case for recursion is the empty list, which returns a list containing only the empty list as its element.
