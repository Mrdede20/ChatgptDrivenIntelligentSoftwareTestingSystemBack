The given code implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which is a sorting algorithm that works on the principle of dividing the given list of elements into two halves, sorting them recursively, and then merging the sorted halves. 

The merge() function in the code merges two sorted halves into one sorted list. 

The mergesort() function itself takes an unsorted list, and recursively divides it into smaller halves until it reaches the base case of lists with 0 or 1 elements. Then it uses the merge() function to combine the sorted halves into a single sorted list. Finally, it returns the sorted list. 

The intention of the code is to sort a given list of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm.
