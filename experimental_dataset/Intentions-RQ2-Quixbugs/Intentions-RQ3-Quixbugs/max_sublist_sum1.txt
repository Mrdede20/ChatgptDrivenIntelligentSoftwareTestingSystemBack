The intention of the code is to implement an algorithm to find the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray within a given list of integers. This algorithm is called the Maximum Sublist Sum problem. The algorithm makes use of two variables to keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and the maximum sum that can be formed by including the current element. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray.
