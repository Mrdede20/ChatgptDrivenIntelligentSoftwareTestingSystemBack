The code is implementing the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming technique. Given a knapsack with maximum weight it can hold and a list of items, each item described by its weight and value, the goal is to find the combination of items that maximizes the value of the knapsack while keeping its weight within the maximum capacity. The function takes the capacity and the list of items as input and returns the maximum total value that the knapsack can hold. 

The function first creates a defaultdict to store the maximum value of the knapsack for each (item, capacity) pair. Then, it loops through each item and each possible capacity to update the maximum value in the dictionary using the values from previous items and capacities. The final maximum value of the knapsack is returned.
