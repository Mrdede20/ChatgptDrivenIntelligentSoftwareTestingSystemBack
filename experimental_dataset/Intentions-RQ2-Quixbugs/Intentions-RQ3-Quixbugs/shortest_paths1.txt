The intention of the code is to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm which is used for finding the minimum-weight paths in a directed graph. Given a source node and a dictionary containing the edge weights keyed by an ordered pair of node ids, this implementation efficiently calculates the minimum path weights from the source node to every other node in the graph. The algorithm works by iterating through all the edges in the graph and relaxing them repeatedly until the shortest path is found. The output of the function is a dictionary that contains the minimum path weights from the source node to every other node in the graph.
