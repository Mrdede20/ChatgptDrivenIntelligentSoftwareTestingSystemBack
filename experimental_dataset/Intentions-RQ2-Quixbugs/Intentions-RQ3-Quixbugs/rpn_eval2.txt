The intention of the code is to implement a function `rpn_eval` that evaluates a list of values and operators encoded in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. 

The function defines an inner function `op` to perform arithmetic operations based on the operator symbol received as argument. The function then creates a stack to keep track of the operands and applies the operators to the operands in the stack until there is only one value left. The final output is the result after evaluating all the operators in the list.
