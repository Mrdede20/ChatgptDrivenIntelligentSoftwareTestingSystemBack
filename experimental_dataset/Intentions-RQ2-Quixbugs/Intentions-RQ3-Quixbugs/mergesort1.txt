The intention of the given code is to perform the merge sort algorithm on a list of integers. The `mergesort()` function takes an input list `arr` and recursively divides it into two halves until each half has only one element or is empty. Once the halves are sorted, the `merge()` function combines them by comparing the elements of both halves and inserting them in the correct order. Finally, the sorted halves are merged to produce the final sorted list. This algorithm is an efficient way to sort elements in a list.
