This code defines a function called `longest_common_subsequence` that takes two strings as input and returns the longest subsequence common to both strings. A subsequence is any sequence of letters in the same order they appear in the string, possibly skipping letters in between. 

The algorithm operates recursively with three cases:

1. If either of the input strings is empty, return an empty string.
2. If the first letter of both strings are equal, add that letter to the output and recursively call the function without the first letter of both strings.
3. If the first letter of the strings are not equal, then recursively call the function with different combinations of input strings and return the longest subsequence.

This function uses recursion to solve the problem and may not be efficient for very long input strings.
