The intention of the code is to find the length of the longest common substring between two given strings s and t using the dynamic programming approach. The code first initializes a dictionary 'dp' to keep track of the length of common suffix for all possible pair of suffixes of both the strings. The dp is populated using bottom-up approach and the length of common substring is returned by finding the maximum value in dp. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(len(s)*len(t)).
