The intention of the above code is to factorize an integer n into its prime factors using naive trial division. It does this recursively by finding the smallest divisor (excluding 1) of n, dividing n by that prime factor, and recursively finding the prime factors of the quotient. This continues until the quotient is equal to 1. The prime factors found along the way are accumulated and returned in sorted order with repetition. This program calculates the prime factorization with the minimum possible computations for integers n greater than or equal to 2.
