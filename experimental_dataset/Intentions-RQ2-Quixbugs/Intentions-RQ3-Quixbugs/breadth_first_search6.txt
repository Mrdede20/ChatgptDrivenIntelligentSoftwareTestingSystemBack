The intention of this code is to implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to check if goalnode can be reached from startnode in a directed graph. BFS algorithm is one of the most basic and commonly used algorithms used for searching a graph or a tree data structure. It explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. In the code, a queue (imported from collections module) is used to keep track of nodes to be explored. The algorithm starts at the startnode and continues exploring its neighbors at each level until it reaches the goalnode or has explored all the reachable nodes, in which case it returns False indicating that the goalnode cannot be reached from startnode.
