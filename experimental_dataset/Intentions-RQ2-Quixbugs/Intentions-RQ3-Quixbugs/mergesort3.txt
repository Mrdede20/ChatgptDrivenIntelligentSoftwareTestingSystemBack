The intention of the code is to implement the Merge Sort algorithm for a given list of integers `arr`. The Merge Sort algorithm uses the technique of dividing a list into halves repeatedly until each sublist contains only one element, and then merging the sublists in a sorted order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. 

The `mergesort()` function implements this algorithm recursively by dividing the input list into left and right sublists, sorting them recursively and then merging them using the `merge()` function. The `merge()` function compares each element of the left and right sublists and adds the smallest element to the result list. Finally, the function returns the sorted list.

The input of the function is a list of integers, and the output is the same list sorted in ascending order. The function achieves a time complexity of O(n log n) and is a widely used and efficient sorting algorithm.
