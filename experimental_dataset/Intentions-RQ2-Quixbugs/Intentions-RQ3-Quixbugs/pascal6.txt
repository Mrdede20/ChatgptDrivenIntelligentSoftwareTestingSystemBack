The intent of the code is to generate and return the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle as a list of n lists where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The algorithm creates a starting row of [1] and then iteratively generates the remaining rows by computing the sum of the two values above and to the left and right of each position.
