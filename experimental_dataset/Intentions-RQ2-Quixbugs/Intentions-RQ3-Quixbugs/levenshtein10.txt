The intention of the code is to implement the Levenshtein Distance algorithm which calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) necessary to transform a source string into a destination string. 

This implementation recursively calculates the distance by comparing the first character of both strings. If the characters are the same, it proceeds with the next characters of both strings. If they are different, it explores all possible paths - deletion, insertion, substitution - to find the path with the minimum distance.
