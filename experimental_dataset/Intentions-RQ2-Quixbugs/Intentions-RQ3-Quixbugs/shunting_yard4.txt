The code defines a function called "shunting_yard" which uses Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix notation (e.g., 10 - 5 - 2) into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) which is a postfix notation (e.g., 10 5 - 2 -). The function takes a list of tokens as input and assumes that each token is either an integer or an operator (+, -, *, /). The function creates an empty list called rpntokens and an operator stack called opstack. The function then iterates through each token in the input list, and if the token is an integer, it appends it to the rpntokens list. If the token is an operator, it compares its precedence with the precedence of the operators currently on the top of the opstack, and if the token has lower or equal precedence, it pops operators off the opstack and appends them to the rpntokens list until either the opstack is empty or the token has higher precedence than the top operator. After iterating through all tokens in the input list, the function pops any remaining operators off the opstack and appends them to the rpntokens list. Finally, the function returns the rpntokens list, which should contain the RPN equivalent of the input list.
