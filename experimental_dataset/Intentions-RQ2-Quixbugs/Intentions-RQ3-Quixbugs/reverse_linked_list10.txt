The intention of this code is to reverse a linked list. The code uses a while loop to iterate through each node in the list, and for each node it swaps the node's `successor` pointer with a `prevnode` variable, effectively reversing the order of the list. The loop continues until all nodes have been reversed and the new head of the list (previously the tail) is returned. The function also mutates the list by changing the `successor` pointers of each node.
