The intention of the code is to generate the first 'n' rows of Pascal's Triangle as a list of n lists. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This code uses a nested loop to iterate through each row of the triangle and calculate the value of each element by adding the numbers at the corresponding positions in the previous row. The result is a list of n lists, with each list representing a row of Pascal's Triangle.
