The intention of the given code is to calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The function takes two string inputs, the source string and target string, and uses recursion to compare the two strings and find the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform the source string into the target string. 

The algorithm works by applying the following logic recursively:

1. If either source or target string is empty, then the Levenshtein distance between the two is the length of the non-empty string.

2. If the first character of the source and target string are same, then the Levenshtein distance is the distance between the substrings obtained by removing the first character from both strings.

3. If the first character of the source and target string are different, then the Levenshtein distance is the minimum of the distance between substring obtained by removing the first character from the target string and keeping the source string same, the distance between the substring obtained by removing the first character from the source string and keeping the target string same, and the distance between the substring obtained by removing the first character from both source and target strings. 

Finally, the function returns the Levenshtein distance between the source and target string.
