The intention of the code is to reverse a given singly-linked list by updating the successor pointers of each node, and then return the new head of the reversed linked list. The code achieves this by traversing the list from the input head node, and at each node, setting the current node's successor pointer to the previous node, and updating the previous node to be the current node. Once the end of the list is reached (when the current node is None), the previous node becomes the new head of the reversed linked list.
