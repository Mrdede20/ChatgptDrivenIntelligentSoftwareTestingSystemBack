The given code implements a function called "lis" which takes an array of unique integers as input and returns the length of the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of the given array. In other words, the function finds the length of the longest sequence of integers in the array such that each element in the sequence is greater than the previous one. This problem is also known as the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" problem. 

The implementation uses dynamic programming to solve the problem with an O(nlogn) time complexity. It maintains a dictionary called "ends" which stores the ending index of the longest increasing subsequence of each length found so far. It then iterates over the input array, and for each element, it finds the length of the longest subsequence that can be extended by that element. The length is computed by finding the longest prefix of the subsequence that ends at the previous element and is less than the current element. If there is more than one such prefix, then the length of the longest prefix is taken. Finally, the ending index of the longest subsequence of that length is updated and the longest length found so far is updated accordingly. The function then returns the longest length found.
