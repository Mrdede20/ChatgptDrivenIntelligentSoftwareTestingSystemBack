The intention of this code is to find the length of the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of a given sequence of integers. The function 'lis' takes an array(arr) and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The program implements a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently solve the problem by iterating over the array and updating the ends dictionary with the indices of the elements that represent the end of the longest increasing subsequence of various lengths. The longest increasing subsequence can be found by iterating over the keys of the ends dictionary and returning the maximum key for which an index is present, resulting in the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
