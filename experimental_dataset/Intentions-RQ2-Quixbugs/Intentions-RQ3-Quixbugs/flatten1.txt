The intention of the code is to define a function called "flatten" that takes a nested list as input and yields a generator for the input's non-list objects. This function uses a recursive approach that iterates over each element in the input list, and if an element is itself a list, calls the flatten function again on that sublist, otherwise yields the element. The end result is the input list flattened into a single list of its non-list objects.
