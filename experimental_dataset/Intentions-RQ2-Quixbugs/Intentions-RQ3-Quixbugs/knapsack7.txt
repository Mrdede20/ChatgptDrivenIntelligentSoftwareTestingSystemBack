The code implements the knapsack algorithm for solving the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem involves choosing a combination of items, each with its own weight and value, to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given maximum weight capacity. The function takes in two arguments: capacity, an integer representing the maximum weight the knapsack can hold, and items, a list of tuples representing each item's weight and value. 

The function starts by creating a dictionary called `memo` that will store the maximum total value of any combination of items that can be chosen for any given weight. It then iteratively fills in the memo dictionary by considering each item in turn and computing, for each weight capacity from 1 up to the maximum capacity, the maximum total value that can be achieved by either including or excluding the current item. Finally, the function returns the maximum total value that can be achieved for the given capacity and items.
