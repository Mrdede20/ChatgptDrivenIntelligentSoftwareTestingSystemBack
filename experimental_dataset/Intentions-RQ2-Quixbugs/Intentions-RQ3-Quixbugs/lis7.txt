The code implements the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence of integers. 

The LIS problem is defined as follows: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

The algorithm works by keeping track of a dictionary `ends` which stores the last element of the subsequence of a given length. The variable `longest` keeps track of the length of the longest subsequence found so far. For each element `val` in the input array, the algorithm finds the longest increasing subsequence that ends with an element smaller than `val`. Then, it checks if `val` can be added to any of these subsequences to form a longer subsequence.

The code returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array.
