The `powerset` function returns a list of lists representing all possible subsets of the given input list `arr`, including the empty set and the list itself. The function uses recursion to generate all possible combinations. The base case of the recursion is when the input list is empty, which returns a single item list containing an empty list. In the recursive case, the function takes the first element of the input list, generates all possible subsets `rest_subsets` of the remaining elements using the same function recursively, and appends this element to each of those subsets to get all subsets containing the first element. Finally, the function combines these subsets with the subsets not containing the first element to get all subsets of the original list.
