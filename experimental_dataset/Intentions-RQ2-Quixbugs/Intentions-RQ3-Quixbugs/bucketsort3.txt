The purpose of this code is to implement the Bucket Sort algorithm that sorts a list of small integers. The function takes two arguments: the list to be sorted and an upper bound (k) of the size of the integers in the list (not inclusive). The function first counts the frequency of each integer in the list and then constructs a new sorted list by appending each integer i, (count[i] - 1) times to the sorted_arr in ascending order of the index i. The pre-condition of the function is that all the elements of the input list should be integers between 0 and k-1. The output of the function is the sorted list.
