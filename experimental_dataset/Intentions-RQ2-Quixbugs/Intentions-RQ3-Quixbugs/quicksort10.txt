The intention of this code is to implement the QuickSort algorithm in Python. QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list of elements to be sorted into two smaller sub-lists. It chooses a "pivot" element and partitions the other elements into two smaller sub-lists according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recurses on each sub-list until the entire list is sorted.

The input to the `quicksort` function is a list of integers (`arr`), and the output is the same list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order .
