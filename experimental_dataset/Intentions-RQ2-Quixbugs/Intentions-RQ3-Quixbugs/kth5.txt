The function `kth()` implements the QuickSelect algorithm to efficiently find the kth-lowest element of a list of integers `arr`. This is equivalent to finding the kth smallest element of the list, if the list is sorted in increasing order. The QuickSelect algorithm selects a pivot element and partitions the remaining list into two sublists - one with elements smaller than the pivot and one with elements larger. If k falls within the range of the smaller sublist, the function recursively calls itself with the smaller sublist. If k falls within the range of the larger sublist, the function recursively calls itself with the larger sublist. Finally, if the pivot is the kth smallest element, it is returned.
