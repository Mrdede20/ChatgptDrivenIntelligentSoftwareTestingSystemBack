The intention of the code is to implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph. The input consists of a weighted graph in the form of a dictionary of {(u, v): weight} for every edge {(u, v)}. The algorithm goes through the edges of the graph in ascending order of weight and checks if adding the edge to the current set of edges creates a cycle. If not, the edge is added to the Minimum Spanning Tree and the algorithm continues until all vertices are connected. Finally, the set of edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree is returned. 

The code is designed to be used as a function, where the input is a dictionary representing a graph and the output is a set of edges representing the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.
