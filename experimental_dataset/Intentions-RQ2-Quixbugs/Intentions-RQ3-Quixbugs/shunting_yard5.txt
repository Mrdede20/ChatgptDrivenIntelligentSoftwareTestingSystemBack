The intention of the code is to implement the shunting yard algorithm to convert infix notation into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The input is a list of tokens in infix notation, which can be integers (operands) or any of the four arithmetic operators ('+', '-', '*', '/'). The function returns a list of tokens reordered into RPN format. RPN is also known as postfix notation, and it is a way to represent arithmetic expressions without using parentheses, which reduces the ambiguity of the order of operations.
