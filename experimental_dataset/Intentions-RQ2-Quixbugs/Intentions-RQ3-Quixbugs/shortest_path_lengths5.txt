The code is an implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which calculates the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. It takes in two inputs: the number of nodes in the graph (n), and a dictionary containing edge lengths keyed by an ordered pair of node ids (length_by_edge). The code returns a dictionary containing shortest path length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. The algorithm works by considering all possible paths between pairs of nodes and selecting the shortest one. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. The method uses defaultdict from collections library to set a default value for keys that do not exist  to be infinity.
