The intention of the code is to implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given value `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The `binsearch` function performs binary search recursively by dividing the array in halves until it finds the index of the target value `x` or determines that `x` is not present in the array. The main function `find_in_sorted` is a wrapper that calls `binsearch` with the start and end indices of the entire array. The returned index indicates the location of `x` in the array, or `-1` if it is not found. The example demonstrates how to use this function on a list `[3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]` to find the index of `5`, which is `3`.
