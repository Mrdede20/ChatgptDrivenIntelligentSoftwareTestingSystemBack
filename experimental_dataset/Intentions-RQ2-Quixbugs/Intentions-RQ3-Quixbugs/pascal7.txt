The intention of this code is to generate the first 'n' rows of Pascal's Triangle where 'n' is a positive integer. The code creates a list of nested lists, where each nested list i.e each row of the triangle, is generated by calculating the sum of the left and right elements of the upper row.

The code first initializes the rows list with the first row of Pascal's triangle i.e [1]. It then iterates over each row from row 2 to row n and generates the row by iterating over each column from 0 to r-1, for each column it calculates the sum of the left and right elements of the upper row (if they exist), and appends it to the new row. Once all the columns of the new row are generated, it appends the row into the 'rows' list. Finally, the code returns the entire 'rows' list with 'n' rows of Pascal's triangle.
