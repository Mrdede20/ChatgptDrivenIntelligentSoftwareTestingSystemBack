The intention of the code is to generate the Minimum Spanning Tree of a given weighted undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm. The input is a dictionary with edges as keys and their corresponding weights as values, representing the weight of each edge. The function returns a set of edges that connect all the vertices of the input graph and has the least possible total weight. The function uses the Union-Find Algorithm to ensure that the set of edges forms a tree and has no cycles.
