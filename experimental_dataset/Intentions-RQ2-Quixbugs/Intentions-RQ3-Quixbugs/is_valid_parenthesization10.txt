The intention of the code is to check whether a given string of parentheses contains a properly nested parentheses or not. 

The `is_valid_parenthesization` function takes a string `parens` as input and iterates through all the characters in the string one by one. If it encounters an opening parenthesis '(', it increases the depth counter `depth` by 1. If it encounters a closing parenthesis ')', it decreases the depth counter `depth` by 1. If at any point during the iteration, the `depth` counter becomes negative, it means that a closing parenthesis has been encountered before an opening parenthesis, hence the parentheses are not properly nested and the function returns False. If the iteration completes successfully and the `depth` counter is zero, it means that all opening parentheses have been closed properly, hence the parentheses are properly nested and the function returns True.

The function also has a precondition that the input string should only contain parentheses (i.e., either '(' or ')'). The function provides two examples to show how the `is_valid_parenthesization` function can be invoked with sample inputs to check whether the parentheses are properly nested or not.
