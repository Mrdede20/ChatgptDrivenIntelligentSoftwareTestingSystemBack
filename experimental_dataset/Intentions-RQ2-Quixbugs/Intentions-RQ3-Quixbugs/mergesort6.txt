The code defines a function called `mergesort` that implements the merge sort algorithm on a given list `arr`. 

Here's how the merge sort algorithm works:

1. If the list has one or zero elements, it is already sorted, and the function returns the list.
2. Otherwise, the list is divided into two halves.
3. Each half is recursively sorted using the `mergesort` function.
4. The two sorted halves are then merged back together using `merge` function defined within `mergesort`.

The `merge` function takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. This is the key operation in merge sort.

Finally, the sorted list is returned by the function.
