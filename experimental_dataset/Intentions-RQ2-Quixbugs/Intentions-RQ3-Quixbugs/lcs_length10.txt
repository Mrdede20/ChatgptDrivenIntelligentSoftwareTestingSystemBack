The intention of the code is to find and return the length of the longest substring that is common in two given strings s and t. The code implements the longest common substring algorithm using dynamic programming. It first initializes a Counter object to store the length of the longest common substring found so far. It then iterates over each pair of characters in the input strings and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it updates the length of the longest common substring up to that point. Finally, it returns the length of the longest common substring found. If there is no common substring found, it returns 0.
