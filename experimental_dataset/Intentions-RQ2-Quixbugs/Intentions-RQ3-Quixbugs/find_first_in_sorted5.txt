The intention of the code is to implement a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given element x in a sorted list. The algorithm takes in two arguments - a sorted array of integers and the value x to be found. The output of the function is the index of the first occurrence of x in the array or -1 if x is not present in the array. 

The code uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of x in the array. The key idea is to keep track of the current range of indices [lo,hi] in the array where x can be found, and keep dividing this range in half until x is found or the range is empty. If the midpoint of the current range is not equal to the target x, we narrow the search to the left or right half of the array depending on whether the midpoint is greater or smaller than the target value. But, if the midpoint is equal to the target value, we check if it is the first occurrence of the value, and return its index if it is.
