The purpose of this code is to implement an efficient algorithm to find the maximum contiguous sublist sum of a given list of integers. The function accepts a list of integers, finds the maximum sum of all the contiguous sublists within the list, and returns that maximum sum. The implementation uses dynamic programming and has a linear time complexity. The function is also documented with an example to demonstrate its usage.
