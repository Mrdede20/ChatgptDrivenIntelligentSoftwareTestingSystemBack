The intention of the given code is to find the next palindromic integer by taking a list of base 10 digits in reverse order. If the given integer is not palindrome then the function may return inappropriate results.

The algorithm works as follows:
Firstly, it finds the mid point of the given digit list.
It then iterates through the list and checks if the digit at the high_mid index is 9, if it is so, the value at the position high_mid and low_mid is set to 0 and high_mid and low_mid index are shifted forward and backward respectively. If the digit at the high_mid index is not equal to 9, it is incremented by 1, if and only if the high_mid and low_mid index are different, the digit at the low_mid index is also incremented by 1.
Finally, if the while loop above has been completely executed, which means that there is no such digit which needs to be incremented, the code returns a new number which has one more digit than the previous number and all digits except the first and last is 0, first and last digits are 1.
