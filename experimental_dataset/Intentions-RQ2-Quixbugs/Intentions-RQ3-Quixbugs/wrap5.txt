The intention of this code is to take a long string (text) and a maximum column width (cols) as input and break the string on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is no longer than the maximum column width specified. If a word in the original text cannot fit in a line without breaking into two parts, the entire word is moved to the next line. The original spaces in the text are preserved, and are not trimmed from the start or end of each line. The output is the ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text.
