The intention of this code is to implement the Depth-first Search algorithm to determine whether a goal node is reachable from a starting node in a directed graph. The algorithm works by starting at the starting node, visiting its neighbors and then recursively visiting each neighbor's neighbors until the goal node is found or all reachable nodes have been visited. The algorithm visits each node only once, and it does so in a depth-first manner, meaning it visits as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The function returns a boolean value, depending on whether or not the goal node was found during the search.
