The intention of the given code is to generate all possible subsequences of length k from the set of integers in the range [a, b]. These subsequences are ascending i.e all elements in the subsequence are in non-descending order. 

The function `subsequences` takes three integer arguments a, b, and k. It recursively generates all subsequences by selecting the first element of the subsequence, and then recursively generating the rest of the subsequence using smaller subsequences. It starts by selecting the first element from the range [a, b-k+1] and then recursively generates the rest of the subsequence using elements from the range [i+1, b]. 

Finally, the function returns a list of all possible subsequences of length k from the given range. For example, calling `subsequences(a=1, b=5, k=3)` would generate a list of all possible length-3 ascending subsequences of integers [1,2,3,4,5] which are [[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,3,4], [2,3,4]].
