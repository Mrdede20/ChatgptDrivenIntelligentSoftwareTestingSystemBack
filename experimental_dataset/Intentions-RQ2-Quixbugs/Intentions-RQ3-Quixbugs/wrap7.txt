The intention of this code is to define a function `wrap` that takes in two arguments - a long string of text and a column width - and returns a list of lines that are no longer than the column width, with no word broken into two parts unless necessary. The original text is broken on spaces into a list of lines such that each line is at most `cols` characters long. 

The function is using a loop to split the text string into multiple lines of length not more than `cols`. The `rfind()` method is applied to find the last space in the `cols + 1` characters of the text string from the start. A line is then created and appended to the list of lines, and the remaining text is updated to remove the line that has already been created. The loop continues until all of the text has been split into lines meeting the column width requirement.
