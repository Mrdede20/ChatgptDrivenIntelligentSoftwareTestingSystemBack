The given code is implementing the Power Set of a list using recursion technique. The Power Set is a set of all possible subsets of a given set. 

The `powerset` function takes a list as input and checks if the list is not empty. If it is not empty, it extracts the first element of the list and recursively calls the `powerset` function on the remaining elements of the list. This will give all the possible subsets of the remaining elements. 

In the next step, it combines the first element with each of these subsets and adds them to the result list. It continues this process until there are no more elements in the list. 

Finally, it returns a list of all possible subsets of the input list, including an empty subset.

For example, `powerset(['a', 'b', 'c'])` will return a list of all possible subsets of ['a', 'b', 'c'] as `[[], ['c'], ['b'], ['b', 'c'], ['a'], ['a', 'c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'c']]`.
