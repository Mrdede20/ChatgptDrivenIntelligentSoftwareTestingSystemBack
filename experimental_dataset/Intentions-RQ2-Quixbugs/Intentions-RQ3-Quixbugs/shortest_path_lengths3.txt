The intention of the code is to implement the Floyd Warshall algorithm for finding the length of the shortest paths between all possible pairs of nodes in a directed graph. 

The code takes in two inputs - the number of nodes in the graph, and a dictionary containing the edge length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. It then uses a nested loop to update the shortest path lengths between each pair of nodes by considering all intermediate nodes. Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the shortest path length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids.

The implementation uses the defaultdict object from the collections module to handle the case when the distance between two nodes is not known. It initially sets the distance between a node and itself to 0 and all other distances to infinity. The algorithm then updates these distances based on the length of the shortest path that goes through an intermediate node k.
