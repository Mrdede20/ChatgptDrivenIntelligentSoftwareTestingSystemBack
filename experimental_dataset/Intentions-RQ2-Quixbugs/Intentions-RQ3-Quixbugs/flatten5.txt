The intention of the code is to define a function `flatten` that takes a nested list as input and flattens it into a single list. 

The implementation works recursively by iterating through the elements of the input list, and for every element that is a list, recursively calling the `flatten` function on it. This is done using generator functions, which lazily generate the flattened list instead of returning it all at once, making it memory-efficient.

The output of the `flatten` function is a generator object that yields the non-list objects of the input in a flattened order. 

The example provided shows how the function can be used to flatten a nested list containing integers and empty lists.
