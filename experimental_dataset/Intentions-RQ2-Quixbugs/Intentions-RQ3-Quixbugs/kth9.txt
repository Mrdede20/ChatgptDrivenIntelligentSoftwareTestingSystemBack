The given code implements QuickSelect algorithm which finds the kth-lowest element in an unsorted list of integers. It selects a pivot element and splits the input list into two sublists, one containing elements smaller than or equal to the pivot, and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively partitions the sublists until it finds the kth element in the desired position. 

The code first selects the first element of the input list as pivot and divides the list into two sublists based on that pivot. Then it calculates the number of elements less than or equal to pivot and the number of elements greater than pivot. If k is less than num_less, QuickSelect is called again on the sublist less than pivot. If k is greater than or equal to num_lessoreq, QuickSelect is called on the sublist greater than pivot. Otherwise pivot is the kth-lowest element and returned.
