The intention of the following code is to implement an algorithm that finds the maximum sum of a sublist in a given list of integers. This is also known as the "maximum subarray" problem. 

The code uses a greedy approach to solve the problem by iterating through the list and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far (max_so_far) and the maximum sum of the sublist ending at the current position (max_ending_here). The max_ending_here is calculated by adding the current element to the running sum or, if that would result in a negative sum, starting a new sublist at the current position. The maximum of the current max_ending_here and the running max_so_far is assigned to max_so_far.

The function then returns the max_so_far value as the maximum sublist sum of the input array.
