The intention of the code is to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm. The input is given as a dictionary with edges as keys and their weights as values. The code iterates over all edges in the sorted order of their weights and adds the edges that do not create any cycles in the minimum spanning tree. It keeps track of the connected components using a dictionary named `group_by_node`. Finally, it returns the set of edges that form the minimum spanning tree. The example at the end of the code is demonstrating how to use the function with sample input data.
