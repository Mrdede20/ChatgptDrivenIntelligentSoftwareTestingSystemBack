The intention of the code is to generate the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle as a list of n lists. The program takes an integer n as input and generates the output using a nested loop that constructs each row of the triangle by adding up the value of the elements in the previous row. The output is a list of n lists where each list represents one row of the triangle. The first list only contains a single element with a value of 1. Subsequent rows are constructed by adding up the two neighboring elements in the previous row.
