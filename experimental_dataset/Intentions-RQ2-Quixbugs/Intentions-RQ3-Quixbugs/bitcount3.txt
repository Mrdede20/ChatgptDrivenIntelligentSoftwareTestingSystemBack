The code defines a function `bitcount(n)` which takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the number of 1-bits in its binary representation. It does this by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the input number and the number one less than it, repeatedly counting the number of iterations required to reduce the input to zero. 

The provided code contains a typo in the function name, calling it `bitcoutn` instead of `bitcount`. Additionally, it may not behave as expected for negative integers, as the bitwise XOR operation with -1 (represented as a series of ones in binary) can cause an infinite loop.
