The intention of the code is to implement a function `lcs_length` that calculates the length of the longest common substring (subsequence) between two strings `s` and `t`. The code uses dynamic programming to build a table (represented by a `Counter` object) to keep track of the length of the common substring at each position in the two strings. The algorithm starts by filling in the table row by row, checking if each character of `s` matches each character of `t`, and storing the length of the common substring up to that position. The final answer is the maximum common substring length stored in the table.
