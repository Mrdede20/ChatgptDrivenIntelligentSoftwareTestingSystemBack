The purpose of this code is to implement a Depth First Search algorithm to determine if a goal node is reachable from a starting node in a directed graph. The search recursively explores each path from the starting node until it finds the goal node or exhausts all possible paths. This implementation uses a nested function `search_from()` to perform the recursive search and keeps track of the visited nodes in a set `nodesvisited`. The function returns `True` if the goal node is reachable from the starting node, otherwise `False`.
