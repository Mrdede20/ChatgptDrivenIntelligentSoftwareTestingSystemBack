The intention of this code is to implement a function named `depth_first_search` that takes two inputs `startnode` and `goalnode`. The function searches whether the `goalnode` is reachable from the `startnode` in a directed graph using the depth-first search algorithm.

The function first creates an empty set called `nodesvisited` to keep track of the visited nodes. Then, it defines an inner function called `search_from` which takes a `node` as input. This inner function recursively searches for the `goalnode` from the `node` using depth-first search. 

If the `node` has already been visited before, then the function returns False because this means we have already explored this path before and we are in a cycle. If the `node` is the `goalnode` we are searching for, then the function returns True because we have found the goal. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to search from the next unvisited node and returns the result.

Finally, the function returns the result of calling the `search_from` function starting from `startnode`.
