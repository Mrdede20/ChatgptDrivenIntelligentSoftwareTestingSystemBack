The intention of this code is to find the length of the longest common substring between two given strings "s" and "t". A substring is a sequence of characters that appear in the same order in both strings. The solution makes use of dynamic programming principles by using a 2D-array to store the lengths of common substrings between substrings of strings "s" and "t". The function iterates over all pairs of substrings, checking if they have a common character. If so, it increments the length of the longest common substring by one. At the end, the function returns the maximum length of common substring between "s" and "t".
