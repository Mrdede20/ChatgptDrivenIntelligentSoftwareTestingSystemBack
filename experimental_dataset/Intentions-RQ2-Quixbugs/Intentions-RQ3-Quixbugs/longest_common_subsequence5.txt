The intention of the code is to find the longest common subsequence between two strings. A subsequence is a sequence of letters that appear in the same order as they appear in the string, possibly skipping letters in between. 

The code uses recursion to find the longest common subsequence. It starts by checking if either of the strings is empty, and if so, returns an empty string. If the first letters of both strings match, it returns the first letter concatenated with the longest common subsequence of the rest of the strings. If the first letters do not match, it recursively calls the function with either the first string and the second string, without their first letters, and returns the maximum result by length. The recursion continues until the base case of an empty string is reached.
