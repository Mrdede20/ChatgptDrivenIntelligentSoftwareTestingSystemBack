The intention of this code is to generate a list of all prime numbers up to a given limit `max` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. 

The algorithm works by starting with a list of all integers from 2 to `max`, and iteratively removing all multiples of each previously discovered prime number from the list. The numbers remaining in the list at the end are all prime numbers.

The code initializes an empty list `primes`, and iterates through all integers from 2 to `max`. For each integer `n`, it checks if any previously discovered prime number `p` is a factor of `n` (i.e. `n % p == 0`). If `n` is not divisible by any prime numbers in `primes`, then `n` must be prime, and it is added to the list.

Finally, the list of prime numbers is returned by the function.
