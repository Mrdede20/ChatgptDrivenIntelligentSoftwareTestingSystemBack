The purpose of this code is to implement the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm, which takes a sequence of integers as an input and returns the length of the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of that sequence. It works by keeping track of ends of all the increasing subsequences that might be the longest, updating them as it processes each element of the input sequence. Finally, it returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence found.
