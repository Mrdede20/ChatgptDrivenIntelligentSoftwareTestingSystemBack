The code is an implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm that can be used to calculate the minimum weight path from a source node to every other node in a directed graph. The algorithm works even for graphs that contain negative weight edges as long as there are no negative-weight cycles. 

The function takes two arguments, the source node from which the path is to be calculated and a dict containing the edge weights keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. The output of the function is a dict that maps each node id to the minimum weight of a path from the source node to that node.
