The intention of this code is to implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. The algorithm takes in the number of nodes in the graph and a dictionary containing the length of edges keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. It uses a nested loop to update the length of the shortest path between any two nodes. The output of the function is a dictionary containing the length of the shortest path keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. The function uses the defaultdict function from the collections module to set the default value of the dictionary as infinity for any key not present to handle cases in which there is no direct path connecting two nodes in the graph.
