The intention of this code is to reverse a singly-linked list. It does this by iterating through each node of the list and changing its successor pointer to point to the previous node. The initial head of the list becomes the new tail since its successor pointer is set to None. The function returns the new head of the reversed list. Note that this code mutates the original list - it changes the successor pointers of each node in the original list.
