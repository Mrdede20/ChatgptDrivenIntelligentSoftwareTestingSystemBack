The intention of the code is to implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b'. The function takes two parameters, 'a' and 'b', and returns the greatest integer that divides both 'a' and 'b' without leaving any remainder. If 'b' is 0, then the function simply returns 'a' as the GCD. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself by taking 'a % b' as the new value of 'a' and 'b' as the old value of 'a'. The recursion continues until 'b' becomes 0 and returns the final value of 'a' as the GCD.
