The `find_in_sorted` function implements the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted list `arr`. This algorithm is used to search for an element in a sorted list of elements by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In each iteration, it compares the middle element of the interval to the target value `x` and decides whether to search the left or right half of the interval. 

The `binsearch` function is a recursive helper function that takes the starting and ending indices of the interval to be searched as arguments. It returns the index of the target value if it is found in the list, or -1 if it is not found.

The `find_in_sorted` function simply calls `binsearch` with the appropriate arguments (the start and end indices of the entire list) and returns the result.

The code has provided an example to show the usage of the `find_in_sorted` function. The example looks for the index of the element `5` in the list `[3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]`. The output shows the index of the first occurrence of `5` in the list.
