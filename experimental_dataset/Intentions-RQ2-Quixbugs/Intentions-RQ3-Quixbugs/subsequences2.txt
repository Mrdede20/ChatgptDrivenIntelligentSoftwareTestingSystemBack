This function generates a list of all possible length-k ascending subsequences of integers in the range from "a" to "b" inclusively. The function takes three parameters: "a" specifies the starting point of the range, "b" specifies the ending point of the range, and "k" specifies the length of the subsequences. It uses recursion and backtracking to generate all possible subsequences.

The function first checks if "k" is zero and returns an empty list if it is. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list "ret" to store the subsequences. It then generates all possible subsequences of length "k" by iterating through the range from "a" to "b + 1 - k" (inclusive). For each index "i" in this range, it appends "i" to each possible subsequence of length "k-1" starting from "i + 1" and ending at "b". It then extends the "ret" list with these generated subsequences.

Finally, the function returns the "ret" list containing all possible length-k ascending subsequences of integers in the range from "a" to "b" inclusively.
