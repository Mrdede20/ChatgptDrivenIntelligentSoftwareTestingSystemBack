The code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph. It takes a dictionary called `length_by_edge`, which contains the length of each edge in the graph, where the keys of the dictionary are ordered pairs of nodes. The algorithm then uses a Fibonacci heap (implemented using `heapq`) to store nodes and their corresponding distances from the starting node. It starts with the starting node, and iteratively pops the node with the minimum distance from the heap until it reaches the goal node. During each iteration, it updates the distances of its neighboring nodes from its current node and pushes them onto the heap. Once it reaches the goal node, it returns the distance of the path. The `get` function searches for a node in the heap and returns its distance, while the `insert_or_update` function either inserts a new node into the heap or updates its distance if it already exists.
