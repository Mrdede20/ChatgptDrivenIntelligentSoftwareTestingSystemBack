The intention of this code is to implement a function that takes an array of digits representing a palindrome number and returns the next palindrome number by incrementing the value of the input number by 1. The algorithm uses two pointers to check the left and right side of the input digit_list to determine the middle element(s) and modify the digits accordingly. The function first checks if the middle elements are 9s and if they are, it increments both sides by 1 and continues scanning. The function returns the digit_list if it has not found any 9s to increment, meaning it's not at a palindrome with all 9s, and has incremented the middle digit(s) by 1. If the function exits the while-loop, then the digit_list was a palindrome with all 9s, so the function constructs and returns an array with a 1 in the front and end with the same amount of zeroes as the length of digit_list.
