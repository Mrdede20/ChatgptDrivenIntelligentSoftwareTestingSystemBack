The intention of the given code is to find the next palindrome number after the number represented by the input list `digit_list`. The approach is to modify the input list in-place until the next palindrome is found. 

The algorithm works as follows:
1. First, the middle position(s) of the current palindrome are found.
2. Then, starting from the middle, the digits are checked from left to right, incrementing the digits next to the middle by 1 where possible.
3. If a digit becomes 9, it is changed to 0 and the digit on the other side of the middle is also changed to 0.
4. This process continues until a suitable next palindrome is found.
5. If the input list is already the largest palindrome, then a new list with one more digit than the previous list and all digits as 0, except the first and last which are 1, is returned.

Finally, the new list representing the next palindrome is returned as the output of the function.
