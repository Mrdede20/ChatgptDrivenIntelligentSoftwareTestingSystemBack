The intention of the code is to implement a function called `get_factors` that computes the prime factorization of a given positive integer `n`. The function returns a list containing the prime factors of `n` in ascending order, with repetition allowed.

The code uses a simple algorithmic approach called `naive trial division`, which starts with the smallest prime number, 2, and divides the input `n` by 2 as many times as possible until it is no longer evenly divisible by 2. The same process is repeated with the next prime number, 3, and continues until the input `n` is fully factored into its prime factors. 

The code uses recursion to simplify the implementation. If a factor is discovered, it calls itself recursively to compute the remaining factors until all prime factors have been computed. If no factor is discovered, an empty list is returned.
