The intention of the given code is to implement binary search algorithm to find an element 'x' in a sorted list 'arr'. The function 'find_in_sorted' takes two inputs, 'arr' and 'x', and searches for the element 'x' in the list 'arr'. If the element 'x' is found in the list 'arr', the function returns the index of the element, otherwise it returns -1. The binary search algorithm is implemented using a recursive function 'binsearch' which takes two indices as input, 'start' and 'end', and searches for the element 'x' in the sub-list of 'arr' starting from the index 'start' and ending at the index 'end'.
