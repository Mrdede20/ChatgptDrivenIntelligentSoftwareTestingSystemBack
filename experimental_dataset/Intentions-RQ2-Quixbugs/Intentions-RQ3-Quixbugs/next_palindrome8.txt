The following code accepts an input list of digits that represents a palindrome and returns the next palindrome in the sequence. The code identifies the midpoint and loops through the digits to increment them in a manner that ensures the resulting number is greater than the input. If the palindrome is already at the maximum value, the code replaces all digits with 0 and increments two digits surrounding the midpoint. If all digits are incremented and the condition is still met, the code adds one to the left of the array and one to the right to create a new palindrome. In conclusion, this code can be used to generate all palindromes greater than the given palindrome.
