The intention of this code is to provide a function called `to_base()` that converts a given base-10 integer (`num`) to a target base (`b`) and returns the result as a string. The function works by performing repeated division with remainder and concatenating the remainders in reverse order to build the converted value. The possible digits used in the target base are defined using `string.digits` and `string.ascii_uppercase` as the alphabet. The example provided demonstrates the usage of `to_base()` to convert the number 31 to base 16, which should result in the string '1F'.
