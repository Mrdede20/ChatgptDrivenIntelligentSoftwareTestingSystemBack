The intention of the given code is to sort a given list of integers using merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by dividing them into smaller and smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains a single element, and then merging those sub-arrays in a sorted manner. The mergesort() function uses recursion to recursively divide the input list in half, and then merges the sorted halves using the merge() function. The merge function performs the actual merging of two sorted sub-arrays back into a larger sorted array. The output of the mergesort() function is a sorted list.
