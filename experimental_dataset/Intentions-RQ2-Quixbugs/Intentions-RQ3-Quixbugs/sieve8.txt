The intention of the code is to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in Python to generate a list of all prime numbers up to a given upper bound (inclusive). 

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting with 2, as composite, until all multiples of all primes have been marked. 

The code works by initializing an empty list called primes, then iterating over all numbers in the range from 2 up to (and including) the given maximum. If the current number n is not divisible by any of the previous primes in the list, then it is added to the primes list. Finally, the list of primes is returned. 

In summary, this code is a straightforward implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and can be used to quickly generate a list of primes for a given upper bound.
