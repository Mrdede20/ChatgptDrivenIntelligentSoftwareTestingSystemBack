The intention of the code is to implement the Levenshtein Distance algorithm which calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one string into another. The function takes two string inputs, source and target, compares the characters and makes recursive function calls until the base case is reached, where one of the strings is empty. At each recursive call, the function determines the minimum number of transformations needed to bring the characters in both strings the same.
