The function `pascal(n)` generates the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle and returns as a list of lists.  

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that displays the coefficients of the binomial expansion for any given power of a binomial. The binomial coefficients are arranged in a triangular pattern. In Pascal's Triangle, the first and last element of each row is 1 and each subsequent value is the sum of the two values immediately above it. 

For example, the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle are: 

        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1

The function implements the logic through creating a list of lists. The first row is [1], then, for each subsequent row, the function generates each element by summing up the two elements of the previous row that are directly above and diagonally beside the current element.
