The intention of this code is to implement the Depth-first Search algorithm to determine if the goalnode is reachable from the startnode in a directed graph. The algorithm visits a node and recursively explores each of its successors until the goal node is found or all reachable nodes have been visited. If the algorithm reaches a node that has already been visited, it backtracks to the previous node until it finds an unvisited successor to explore. The code returns a boolean value indicating whether the goalnode is reachable from the startnode.
