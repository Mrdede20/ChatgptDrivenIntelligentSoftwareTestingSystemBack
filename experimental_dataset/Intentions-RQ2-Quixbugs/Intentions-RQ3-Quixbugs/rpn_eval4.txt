The intention of the code is to implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator which evaluates arithmetic expressions given as tokens in RPN. RPN is a means of representing mathematical expressions in a postfix form where the operator comes after the operands. This implementation evaluates the expression by pushing operands onto a stack and then performing the operation when an operator is encountered. 

The `rpn_eval` function takes a list of tokens and initializes an empty stack. Then for each token in tokens, if the token is a float then it is pushed onto the stack. Otherwise, if the token is an operator, it pops off the two most recent elements from the stack, applies the operator to these two elements, and pushes the result back onto the stack. Finally, when there is only one element remaining on the stack, that element is returned as the evaluated result of the RPN expression.
