The intention of the code is to convert a mathematical expression in infix notation to an equivalent expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), using the shunting-yard algorithm. The input should be a list of tokens, where each token represents a number or mathematical operator. The function first defines the precedence of the operators using a dictionary, then iterates through the tokens and uses the algorithm to reorder them into RPN. The final RPN expression is returned as a list of tokens.
