The intention of the code is to generate a list of all possible subsets of the input list 'arr'. The function named 'powerset' takes a single argument, a list 'arr' that has no duplicate elements. 

The function uses recursion to generate the set of all subsets of the input list. In each recursive call, it selects the first element (first) of the input list and then generates the subsets for the remaining elements (rest) using the same function.

Finally, it combines the 'first' element with each of the subsets generated for the remaining elements and returns a list of all possible combinations. This is the essence of the algorithm to generate all subsets of a given set.
