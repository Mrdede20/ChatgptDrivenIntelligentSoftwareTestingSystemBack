The intention of the code is to calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The Levenshtein distance is the minimum amount of single-character edits required to transform one string into another. The code takes two inputs, source and target strings, and returns the Levenshtein distance. The approach uses a recursive implementation of the algorithm where if the first character of both strings is the same, then no change is needed, and the pointer moves to the next character. If the first characters are not same, the function call made three times to check for minimum distance between two strings with different edit operations like insertion, deletion, and replacement of characters.
