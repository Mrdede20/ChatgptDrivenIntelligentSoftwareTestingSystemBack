The intention of the code is to define a function `flatten` that takes in a nested list as input and flattens it into a single list by recursively traversing the input list and yielding non-list objects. 

The `flatten` function uses a recursive approach where it checks if each element in the input list is a list or not. If the element is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten the nested list. If the element is not a list, it yields the value to the caller. 

Overall, the code is trying to provide an efficient way to flatten a nested list by using a generator function that generates output one value at a time, rather than computing the entire flattened list in memory.
