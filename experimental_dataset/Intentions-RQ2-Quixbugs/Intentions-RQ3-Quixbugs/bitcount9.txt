The intention of the code is to implement a function called `bitcount` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of 1-bits in the binary encoding of `n`. The given code, however, implements a similarly named function called `bitcoutn` (which seems to be a typo) that uses bitwise XOR to count the number of bits in `n`. 

The code repeatedly XORs `n` with `n - 1` until `n` becomes 0, and simultaneously counts the number of iterations it takes to reach 0. Each iteration replaces the rightmost 1-bit in `n` and all the bits to its right with 0s, effectively counting the number of 1-bits in `n`. 

The code seems to work correctly for non-negative integers, but it doesn't handle negative numbers correctly. If `n` is negative, the function goes into an infinite loop. Therefore, this function can only be used for non-negative integers.
