The intention of the code is to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate minimum-weight paths in a directed graph that may contain negative edges (as long as there are no negative-weight cycles). The input to the function is a source node id and a dictionary containing edge weights keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. The function returns a dictionary mapping each node id to the minimum weight of a path from the source node to that node. 

The implementation initializes all node weights to infinity, sets the weight of the source node to 0, and then iteratively updates node weights by considering all edges until there is no further improvement. The function assumes that the input graph does not contain any negative-weight cycle.
