The intention of the given code is to find the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b'. It uses the recursive approach to find the gcd of 'a' and 'b' by dividing 'a' by 'b' until the remainder is 0. In this approach, the 'a' is set as the new 'b' and the remainder 'a%b' is set as the new 'a'. This process continues until the remainder is 0, in which case the current value of 'b' is the gcd of the original 'a' and 'b'. The algorithm works on the principle that the gcd of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.
