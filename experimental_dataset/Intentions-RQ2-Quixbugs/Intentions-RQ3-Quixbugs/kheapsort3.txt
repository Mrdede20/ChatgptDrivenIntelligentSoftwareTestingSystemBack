The intention of the code is to perform a K-Heapsort, which is a variation of Heapsort. An almost-sorted array, where each element is no more than K units from its sorted position can be sorted in `O(n*log(k))` time complexity using K-Heapsort. The code takes an input array `arr` and an integer `k` as the maximum displacement of an element from its final sorted location. The `heapify()` method is used to create a heap of the first k elements of the array. Next, for each remaining element of the array, `heappushpop()` method is used to add the element to the heap and pop the minimum element from the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains only k elements. Finally, the remaining elements of the heap are popped in ascending order using `heappop()`. The code returns a generator object that yields the elements of `arr` in sorted order.
