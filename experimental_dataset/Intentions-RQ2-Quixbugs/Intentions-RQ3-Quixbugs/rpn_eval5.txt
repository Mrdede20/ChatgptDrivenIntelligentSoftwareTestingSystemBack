The intention of the code is to implement a function `rpn_eval` that evaluates a mathematical expression given in reverse polish notation.

The function takes in a list of tokens, where the tokens can be either floating point numbers or mathematical operators (+,-,*,/). The function iterates over the tokens, and if it encounters a number, it stores it in a stack. If it encounters an operator, it pops two numbers from the stack, applies the operator to them, and pushes the result back to the stack. 

Finally, when it has processed all tokens, it returns the final value left on top of the stack. 

The function defines a helper function called `op` that returns a lambda function corresponding to each mathematical operator. This helper function is used to apply the operator to the two operands popped from the stack.
