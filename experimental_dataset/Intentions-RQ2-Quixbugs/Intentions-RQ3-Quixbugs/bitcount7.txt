The intention of the code is to implement a function called `bitcount` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the number of 1-bits in the binary encoding of `n`. 

The implementation achieves this by using a bitwise XOR operation to continually toggle the least significant 1-bit in `n` until all 1-bits have been counted. The function also handles negative input values by first converting them to their 2's complement representation. 

The provided code has a function definition called `bitcount` but the function that was actually written and called is named `bitcoutn`, which seems to be a typo. Additionally, some of the function calls use incorrect function names. So, it is necessary to update the function names and call the `bitcount` function instead of `bitcoutn`.
