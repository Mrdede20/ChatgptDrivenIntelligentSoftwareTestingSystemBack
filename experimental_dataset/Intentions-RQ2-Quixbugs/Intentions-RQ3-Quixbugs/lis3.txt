The given code implements the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" algorithm. It takes a sequence of integers as input and returns the length of the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of that sequence.

The algorithm maintains a dictionary named "ends" that stores the ends of all increasing subsequences of different lengths seen so far. Initially, the dict is empty and the length of the longest subsequence is set to 0.

The algorithm then iterates over each element in the input sequence and calculates the lengths of all increasing subsequences that end with this element. It does this by looking for all prefixes of increasing subsequences that end with a value less than the current element. The length of the longest prefix is then calculated, which becomes the length of the increasing subsequence that ends with the current element.

If the calculated length is the same as the length of the longest subsequence seen so far or if the current element is smaller than the end element of the next longest subsequence seen so far, the "ends" dict is updated with the new end element and the length of the longest subsequence is updated accordingly.

Finally, the function returns the length of the longest subsequence.
