The intention of the code is to implement a recursive function that takes an integer `n` and returns its prime factors as a list of integers. The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1, in which case an empty list is returned. If `n` is not equal to 1, the function iterates over the range `2` to the square root of `n` (inclusive) checking if each number is a factor of `n`. If a factor is found, the function calls itself recursively with the argument `n // i` and adds the factor `i` to the list that is returned. If no factor is found within the range `2` to the square root of `n`, an empty list is returned. The function assumes that the input `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
