The given code is written in Python and it generates the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle as output. The Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients that has its first row as [1] and each following number in each row is found by adding up the two numbers diagonally above it. To generate the triangle, the code first creates a 2D list rows with the first row as [1] and then iteratively calculates each subsequent row by adding up the diagonally above positive numbers in the previous row. Finally, the first n rows of the Pascal's Triangle are returned.
