The given code implements a recursive algorithm to solve the well-known Towers of Hanoi puzzle. 

The puzzle consists of three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes which can be slid onto any peg. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one peg, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following rules:

- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The `hanoi` function takes in three arguments:
- `height` - the height of the initial stack of disks
- `start` - the numbered peg where the initial stack resides
- `end` - the numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto

The function recursively calls itself on subproblems of smaller sizes by moving discs of sizes in descending order from the starting peg to the destination peg via a spare peg.

The function returns an ordered list of pairs (a, b) representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving the top disk from peg a to peg b) that solves the puzzle.
