This code defines a function `wrap()` that takes in two parameters, `text` (a long string) and `cols` (an integer representing the column width). The function breaks the string into a list of lines, each no longer than the specified column width. The function ensures that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless it is necessary. The original amount of spaces is preserved, and spaces at the start or end of each line are not trimmed. The function returns an ordered list of strings as the output. The code also includes a docstring that provides information about the function, its purpose, and its expected inputs and outputs.
