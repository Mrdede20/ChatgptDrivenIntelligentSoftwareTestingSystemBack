The intention of the code is to perform a Depth-first search (DFS) on a directed graph represented by nodes and their successors/children, starting from a specified start node and searching for a goal node. The algorithm returns a boolean value indicating whether the goal node can be reached from the start node through any sequence of successors. The code maintains a set of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops in cyclic graphs. The DFS algorithm is implemented using the recursive function `search_from()` which checks if the current node is the goal node or any of its successors leads to the goal node.
