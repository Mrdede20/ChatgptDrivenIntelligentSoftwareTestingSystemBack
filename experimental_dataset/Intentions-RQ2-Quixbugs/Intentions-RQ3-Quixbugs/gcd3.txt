The intention of the code is to implement the Greatest Common Divisor algorithm using recursion. The function takes two non-negative integers a and b as input and returns the greatest integer that evenly divides both a and b. 

The algorithm uses a recursive approach where the function calls itself with the values (a % b) and b until b is equal to 0. In other words, it keeps finding the remainder when a is divided by b and updates the value of a to b and the value of b to the remainder until b becomes 0. At this point, the function returns the current value of a, which is the GCD of the original a and b.
