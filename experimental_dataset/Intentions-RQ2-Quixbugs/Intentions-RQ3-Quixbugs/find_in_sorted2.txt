The intention of the code is to implement a binary search algorithm to find a given element `x` in a sorted list `arr`. The binary search efficiently locates the given element by dividing the search interval in half at every iteraction. This implementation uses a recursive function `binsearch` that takes the start and end indices of the search interval as arguments. It returns the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.
