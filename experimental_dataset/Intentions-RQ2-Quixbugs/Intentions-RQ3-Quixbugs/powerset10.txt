The `powerset` function takes a list `arr` and returns a list of all the possible subsets of `arr`, including the empty set and `arr` itself. It uses recursion to generate all the subsets, starting with the empty list as the base case.

The function works by recursively finding all the subsets of the remaining elements of the list (`rest`) and then adding the first element of the original list (`first`) to each of those subsets. This generates all the possible subsets that include `first`. Then, it combines those subsets with the subsets that don't include `first` (i.e., the ones generated from `rest`), since every subset of the original list is either a subset that includes `first` or one that doesn't.

The function then returns the list of all the combined subsets.

Note that the function assumes that `arr` has no duplicate elements, so it may not work correctly for lists with duplicates. Also note that the function uses a Python 3-specific feature (`*rest`) to extract the first element of the list and the remaining elements.
