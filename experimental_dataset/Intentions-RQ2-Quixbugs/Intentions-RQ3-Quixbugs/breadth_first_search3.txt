The intention of the following code is to implement the Breadth-First Search algorithm to find whether the goal node is reachable from the start node in a directed graph. The function takes the start and goal nodes as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the goal node is reachable from the start node. The algorithm starts exploring the graph from the start node by adding it to a queue and then processing each node in the queue one by one. For each node, it adds its successors to the queue if they have not been explored before and adds them to the set of seen nodes. The algorithm continues until the goal node is found or all nodes have been explored.
