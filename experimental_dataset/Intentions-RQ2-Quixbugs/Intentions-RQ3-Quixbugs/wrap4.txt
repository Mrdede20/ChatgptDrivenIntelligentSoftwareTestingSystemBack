The intention of the code is to create a function called `wrap` that takes in two arguments, `text` and `cols`. The function iterates through the `text` and breaks it on any spaces into lines that are no longer than the `cols`.  The output is a list of strings that are the broken down lines.

This function is useful when we need to display long texts without having the lines exceed a predetermined maximum width. It can be used for formatting strings in a document, email or webpage layout, or to ensure that text within a certain column or container size does not spill over the edge.
