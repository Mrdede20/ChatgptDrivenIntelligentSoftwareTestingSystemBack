The given code implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm starts traversing the graph/digraph from the given start node or origin and explores all the neighbors or children of the current node before moving ahead in the search space. The algorithm works by maintaining a queue of nodes to be processed and a set of nodes that have already been processed.

The function `breadth_first_search` takes two arguments, `startnode` and `goalnode`, which are starting and final nodes of the search space, respectively. The function returns `True` if the `goalnode` is reachable from `startnode`, and `False` otherwise.

To implement BFS, the function uses the `deque` data structure from `collections` module to form a queue. The function first adds the `startnode` to the queue and also adds it to the set of `nodesseen` which keeps track of all the visited nodes. The function then loops until the queue is empty or the `goalnode` is reached. In each iteration, the first node from the queue is popped and checked if it is the `goalnode`. If it is, the function returns `True`. If not, the successors of the current node are added to the queue if they are not already visited, and they are marked as visited by adding them to the `nodesseen` set. Finally, if the `goalnode` is not found, the function will return `False`.
