The intention of the above code is to implement the QuickSort algorithm to sort a given list of integers 'arr'. The Quicksort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the list and dividing the remaining elements of the list into two separate sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively applies the QuickSort algorithm to each sub-array until the entire list is sorted.
