The code performs a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph represented as a list of nodes. The function takes in the nodes of the graph and returns an ordered list of nodes such that for every pair of nodes (u, v) where there is an edge from u to v, u comes before v in the ordered list. The ordered list is computed using a depth-first search algorithm that iteratively adds nodes to the list based on whether all their incoming nodes have already been added to the list.
