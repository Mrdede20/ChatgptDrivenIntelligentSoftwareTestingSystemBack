The intention of this code is to reverse a given singly-linked list by iterating through each node in the list and changing its `successor` pointer to point to the previous node. It uses the variables `prevnode` and `nextnode` to keep track of the previous and next nodes respectively, and it updates the `successor` pointer of the current node to `prevnode`. Once it has iterated through the entire list, it returns the new head of the reversed linked list. This code has a side effect of mutating the `successor` pointers of each node in the list.
