The code implements an algorithm to solve the classic problem of the Tower of Hanoi, which involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, obeying certain rules. The `hanoi` function takes three parameters: `height`, which is the height of the initial stack of disks; `start`, which is the numbered peg where the initial stack resides (default is 1); and `end`, which is the numbered peg which the stack must be moved onto (default is 3). 

The function returns an ordered list of pairs `(a, b)` representing the shortest series of steps (each step moving the top disk from peg `a` to peg `b`) that solves the puzzle. The algorithm uses recursion to solve the problem, by breaking it down into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached (when `height` is 0), and then building up the solution based on the solutions to the subproblems.
