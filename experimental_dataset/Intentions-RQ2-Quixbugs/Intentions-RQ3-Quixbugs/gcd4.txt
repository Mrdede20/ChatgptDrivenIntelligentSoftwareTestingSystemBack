The intention of the code is to find the greatest common divisor (also known as greatest common factor) of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b'. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to recursively find the GCD. The algorithm states that if we subtract the smaller number from the larger number, the GCD of the resulting pair is the same as the original pair. This process can be repeated until one of the numbers is reduced to 0, at which point the other number is the GCD.

The function takes two arguments 'a' and 'b', and returns the GCD of the two numbers by recursively calling itself with a modified value for 'a' and 'b'.

The function first checks if the value of the second argument 'b' is zero. If it is zero, the function returns the value of 'a' as the GCD. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with 'a' % 'b' as the new value for 'a' (remainder when 'a' is divided by 'b') and 'b' as the new value for 'b'.
