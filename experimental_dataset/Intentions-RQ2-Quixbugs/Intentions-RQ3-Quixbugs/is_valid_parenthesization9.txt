The intention of the code is to determine if a given string of parentheses `parens` is properly nested or not. The code loops through each character in `parens` and keeps track of the depth of the nesting by adding 1 to `depth` for every '(' encountered and subtracting 1 from `depth` for every ')' encountered. If `depth` ever becomes negative, it means that there is a closing ')' without a corresponding opening '(', so the function returns False. Finally, if `depth` remains 0 by the end of the loop, then all the parentheses are properly nested, so the function returns True. 

The examples demonstrate how the `is_valid_parenthesization` function can be used to check whether different strings of parentheses are properly nested.
