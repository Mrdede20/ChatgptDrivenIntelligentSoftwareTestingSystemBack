The intention of the code is to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm which is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. The code takes a source node and a dictionary of edge weights as inputs and computes the minimum weight of a path from the source node to every other node in the graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. When the algorithm is run, it computes the shortest path in a series of iterations. In each iteration, it updates the minimum distance to each node based on the distances to its neighbors. The algorithm stops when it has reached the minimum distance to each node or detects a negative-weight cycle.
