The intention of the following code is to implement the Newton-Raphson method for finding the square root of a given floating-point number 'x' with an accuracy up to a tolerance level 'epsilon'. 

The initial guess for the square root is taken as half of the given number. The function iteratively calculates the new approximations using the Newton-Raphson method until the difference between the approximation and actual value becomes less than the tolerance level. Finally, it returns the approximation as the square root of the given number.

The code also includes a docstring that explains the purpose of the function along with the expected input and output values with an example of using the function.
