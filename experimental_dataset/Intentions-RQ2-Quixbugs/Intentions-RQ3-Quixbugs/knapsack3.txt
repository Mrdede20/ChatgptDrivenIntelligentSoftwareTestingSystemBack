The code implements a solution for the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming approach. Given a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity and a set of items each with a weight and value, the function calculates the maximum total value of any combination of items that can be added to the knapsack without exceeding its capacity. 

The function creates a defaultdict to memoize the optimal solutions for subproblems. It uses nested loops to iterate through each item and each capacity value from 1 to the maximum knapsack capacity. At each iteration, it checks if the current weight is less than or equal to the current capacity. If yes, it finds the maximum of the current value plus the value of the optimal solution for the remaining capacity after adding the current item and the optimal solution for the previous item with the same capacity. If not, it simply takes the optimal solution for the previous item and the same capacity. Finally, it returns the optimal solution for the last item and the max capacity. 

The function has a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum capacity of the knapsack. It has a space complexity of O(nW) as well due to memoization.
