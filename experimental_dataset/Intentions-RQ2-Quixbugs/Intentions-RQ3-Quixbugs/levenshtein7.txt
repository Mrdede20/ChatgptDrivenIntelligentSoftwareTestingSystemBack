The intention of this code is to calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum amount of single-character edits (either removing a character, adding a character, or changing a character) necessary to transform a source string into a target string. 

The function takes two arguments: the source string and the target string. If either string is an empty string, the function returns the length of the non-empty string. If the first characters of both strings match, it recursively calculates the Levenshtein distance for the remaining parts of the strings. If they don't match, it recursively calculates the Levenshtein distance for three different operations: removing a character from the target string, adding a character to the source string or changing a character in the source string, and then calculates the minimum distance among those three. Finally, the minimum distance is returned.
