The intention of this code is to implement the Bucket Sort algorithm which sorts a list of small integers by dividing them into subsets (buckets) and then sorting each bucket individually using another sorting algorithm like insertion sort. This particular implementation uses counting sort for sorting each bucket. The upper bound of the size of the integers in the input list is specified using the parameter 'k'. The function takes as input a list 'arr' and an upper bound 'k' and returns the sorted list 'sorted_arr'. The input is assumed to satisfy a precondition which states that every element in 'arr' is an integer between 0 and k-1.
