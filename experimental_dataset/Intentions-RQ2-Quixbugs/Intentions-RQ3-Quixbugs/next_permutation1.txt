The intention of the code is to implement an algorithm to find out the next lexicographically larger permutation of a given list of integers `perm`. The code efficiently computes the next permutation of the list in the lexicographical order i.e, the smallest possible permutation that can be obtained by rearranging the elements of the list in ascending order. The implementation makes use of swapping the elements of the list based on certain conditions, and then reverses the elements at the end of the list to obtain the next permutation in the lexicographical order. The function takes the given list as input and returns the next permutation of the elements of perm. The code has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the given list `perm`.
