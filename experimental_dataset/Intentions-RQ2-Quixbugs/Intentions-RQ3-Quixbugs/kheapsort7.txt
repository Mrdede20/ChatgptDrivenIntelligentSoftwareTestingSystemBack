The intention of the code is to implement K-Heapsort algorithm. K-heapsort is an extension of heapsort that is used when the input array is almost sorted. In an almost sorted array, each element is at most k units away from its final sorted position. The k-heapsort algorithm can sort such an array in O(n log k) time, which is faster than the O(n log n) time complexity of typical heapsort.
