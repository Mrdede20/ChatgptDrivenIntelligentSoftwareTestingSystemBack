The intention of the code is to generate all possible length-k ascending sequences of integers in the range from a to b (inclusive). It does this by recursively generating sequences starting from each integer in the range and appending each integer to the rest of the sequence generated from the next integer. Finally, it returns a list of all generated sequences. 

For example, given a=1, b=5, and k=3, it should generate the following sequences: [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], and [2, 3, 4].
