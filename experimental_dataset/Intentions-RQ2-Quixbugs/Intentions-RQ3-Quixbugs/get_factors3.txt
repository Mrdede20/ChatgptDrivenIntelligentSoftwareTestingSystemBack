The intention of the code is to implement a function `get_factors()` that factors an integer into its prime factors using naive trial division. The function returns a sorted list of prime factors that can have repetition. 

The implementation first handles the edge case where the input is 1 and returns an empty list. For any other input greater than 1, it starts with 2 and checks if it is a factor of the input. If it is, it returns a list that contains 2 as a factor and the factors of (n // 2). If 2 is not a factor, the function checks odd numbers up to the square root of the input to see if they are factors. If it finds a factor, it returns a list containing that factor and the factors of (n // factor). If it doesn't find any factors up to the square root, it returns an empty list.
