The presented code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph. It takes three inputs - a dictionary of directed edges and their lengths, startnode and goalnode. The function maintains two sets: unvisited_nodes and visited_nodes. The former is implemented as a FibHeap containing (node, distance) pairs. The while-loop processes each node until the goalnode is reached. For every node in the unvisited_nodes set, it finds its connected nodes and updates their distances if they are less than the previous distance. At the end, the function returns the shortest path between startnode and goalnode.
