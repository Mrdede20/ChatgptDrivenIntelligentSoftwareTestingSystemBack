The intention of the code is to wrap a long string into a list of lines, where each line has a length no longer than a specified column width. The function achieves this by breaking the string on spaces into multiple lines, and adding each line to a list. The function takes two arguments: the original text and the column width, and returns the list of lines. 

The function works by repeatedly finding the last space within the specified column width, and breaking the string at that point to form a new line. If there are no spaces within the column width, then the string is simply broken at the column width. The resulting lines are added to a list which is returned at the end of the function. The original text is preserved and no word is broken into two parts unless necessary.
