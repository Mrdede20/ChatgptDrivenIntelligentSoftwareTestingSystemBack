The intention of the code is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b. The function gcd(a, b) returns the gcd of a and b by recursively dividing the larger number by the remainder of dividing the smaller number until the smaller number becomes 0. Once the smaller number reaches 0, the function returns the larger number, which is the GCD of the original two numbers. This implementation uses the Euclidean Algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers.
