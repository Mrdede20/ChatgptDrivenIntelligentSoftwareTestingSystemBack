The given code implements the Newton-Raphson method to calculate the square root of a given number 'x' with an error tolerance of 'epsilon'. The initial approximation is taken as x/2 and the algorithm keeps iterating until the absolute difference between the approximated square root and the actual square root is lesser than the error tolerance 'epsilon'. 

The code returns the approximated square root that lies within the range [sqrt(x) - epsilon, sqrt(x) + epsilon]. 

The function precondition specifies that the input 'x' should be greater than or equal to 1 and the input 'epsilon' should be greater than 0. 

The last example shows the usage of this function that gives the output as the approximated square root of 2 with an error tolerance of 0.01.
