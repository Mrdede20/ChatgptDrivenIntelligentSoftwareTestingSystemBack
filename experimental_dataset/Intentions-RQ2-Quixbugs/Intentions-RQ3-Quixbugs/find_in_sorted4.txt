The intention of the code is to perform a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of a given value in the list. The find_in_sorted function takes in two parameters, an array of sorted integers and the value to search for. It then defines a nested binsearch function which performs the recursive binary search algorithm on the array to find the index of the given value. If the value is not found in the array, it returns -1. The function returns the result of calling the binsearch function with the start and end indices of the array.
