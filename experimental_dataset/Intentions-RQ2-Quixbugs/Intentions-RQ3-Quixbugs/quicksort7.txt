The intention of the given code is to perform the QuickSort algorithm on the given list of numbers to return a sorted list. The function `quicksort()` takes an input parameter `arr` which is the unsorted list of integers. The QuickSort algorithm works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Then the algorithm recursively sorts the sub-arrays. 

In the given code, the first element of `arr` is selected as the pivot element. Then two sub-arrays are created, one containing all the elements that are less than the pivot, and another containing all the elements that are greater than the pivot. The `quicksort()` function is then recursively called on each of these sub-arrays, until each sub-array has only one element. Finally, the sub-arrays are merged together to form a sorted array, which is returned as the output of the function.
