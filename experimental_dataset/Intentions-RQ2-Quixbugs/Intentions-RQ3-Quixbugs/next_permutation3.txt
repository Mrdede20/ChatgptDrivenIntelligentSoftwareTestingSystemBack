The intent of the code is to generate the next lexicographically greater permutation of a list of unique integers, given the current permutation as input. The function takes a list of unique integers as input and returns the next permutation such that the list is not in reverse order. 

The code first checks if the permutation is not in reverse order. Then it loops through the elements of the permutation from the second last element to the first element. It checks if there is a decreasing sequence in the list. If it finds such a sequence, it swaps the smallest element in the decreasing sequence with the next largest element in the list, and then reverses the sublist to the right of the swapped element. This results in the lexicographically next permutation of the list with the given permutation.
