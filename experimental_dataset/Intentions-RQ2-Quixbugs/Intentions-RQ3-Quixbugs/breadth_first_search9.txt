The intent of the code is to implement Breadth-First-Search algorithm to traverse a directed graph, starting from a given start node and stopping when a goal node is reached. The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited next. In each iteration, the node at the front of the queue is removed and checked. If it is the goal node, the algorithm returns True, else it adds the successors of the current node to the queue, and marks them as seen. The algorithm continues until either the goal node is found, or the queue is empty, in which case it returns False.
