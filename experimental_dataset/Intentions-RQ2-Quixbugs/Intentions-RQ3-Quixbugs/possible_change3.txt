The intention of the code is to find the number of distinct ways to make change for a given total value, using coins with given denominations. The function first checks if the total is zero, then returns 1 because there is only one way to make no change. If the total is less than zero, return 0 because it is impossible to make change with negative total value. 

The function then selects the first coin in the list of denominations and examines two options: either use the coin, in which case the total value will decrease by the coin denomination, or skip the coin altogether. The function recursively repeats this procedure, reducing the total and considering coins one-by-one, until all the possible combinations of coins have been checked. Finally, it returns the sum of all possible ways to change the given total using the given coins of denominations.
