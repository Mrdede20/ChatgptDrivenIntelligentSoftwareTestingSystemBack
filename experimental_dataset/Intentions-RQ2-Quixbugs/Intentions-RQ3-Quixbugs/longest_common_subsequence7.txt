The given code finds the longest common subsequence between two given strings 'a' and 'b'. It recursively reduces the problem by comparing the first character of both the strings `a[0]` and `b[0]`. 

If both the characters match, it concatenates the character to the result string, and recursively call the function by removing the first character from 'a'. 

If both the characters do not match, it runs recursive comparison for two possibilities:-

1. By removing the first character from 'b'
2. By removing first character from 'a'

And, then returns the subsequence with the maximum length from it, thus finding the longest common subsequence between 'a' and 'b'.
