This code defines the function `longest_common_subsequence` which takes in two strings `a` and `b` as inputs and returns the longest common subsequence string. A subsequence is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the given strings, possibly with characters skipped in between. 
The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the longest common subsequence. It first checks whether either of the strings is empty, in which case it returns an empty string. If the first characters of the two strings are the same, then that character is added to the subsequence, and the function is recursively called with the next characters of both strings. If the first characters are different, then the function is called recursively with either the first string and the rest of the second string or the first two characters of the first string and the rest of the second string or vice versa, whichever yields the longest subsequence. If there are multiple subsequences of equal length, either one is returned.
