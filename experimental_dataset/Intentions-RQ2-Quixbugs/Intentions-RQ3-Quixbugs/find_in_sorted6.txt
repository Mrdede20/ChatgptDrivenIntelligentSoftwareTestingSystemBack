The intention of the code is to implement a binary search algorithm to find a target value 'x' in a sorted list 'arr'. The binary search algorithm starts by dividing the list in half and determining if the target value is greater or less than the midpoint. If the target value is less, it recursively searches the left half of the list, and if it is greater, it recursively searches the right half of the list. This process repeats until the target value is found or the algorithm determines that the value is not in the list. If the target value is found, the index i of the value is returned, otherwise, -1 is returned to indicate that the value is not in the list.
