The code is an implementation of the recursive algorithm to solve the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to transfer a tower of disks of different sizes from one peg to another peg, with the constraint that a larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The `hanoi()` function takes three arguments: `height` (the height of the initial stack of disks), `start` (the peg where the initial stack resides), and `end` (the peg where the stack must be moved onto). If not specified, `start` defaults to 1 and `end` defaults to 3.

The function returns a list of steps, represented by pairs of pegs (the first element is the starting peg, the second element is the destination peg), that solve the puzzle.

The function follows a recursive approach. If the `height` of the stack is greater than zero, it first recursively calls `hanoi()` with a lower `height` value to move the top portion of the tower from the starting peg to the other peg. Then it appends a move for the bottom disk to the list of steps, and recursively calls `hanoi()` again to move the top portion of the tower from the other peg to the destination peg. 

This process continues recursively with smaller subproblems until the height of the subproblem (i.e., the number of disks to move) is zero, at which point the function returns an empty list of steps.
