The intention of the code is to define a function called `flatten` that takes a nested list as an argument and returns a generator for its non-list objects. 

The function uses recursion to iterate through the nested list and checks whether each element is a list or not. If an element is a list, the function recursively calls itself on that sublist. Otherwise, the function uses the `yield` keyword to return the non-list object.

By using a generator, the function can be memory efficient and work well for large nested lists, as it only generates each element as needed instead of storing them all in memory at once. 

The code includes a docstring that explains the input, output, and examples of how to use the function.
