The intention of this code is to implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an undirected connected weighted graph. The function takes in a dictionary of edge weights, where each key is a tuple representing an undirected edge, and each value is the weight of that edge. The function then uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a set of edges that connects all vertices of the input graph with the least possible total weight. The algorithm works by iteratively adding edges of increasing weight to the MST while ensuring that no cycles are formed. The final set of edges returned represents the MST of the input graph. The code also includes a docstring that provides further details on the input and output of the function.
