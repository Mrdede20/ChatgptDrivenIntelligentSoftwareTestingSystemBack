The given code implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of an undirected connected graph. The function takes a dictionary `weight_by_edge` as input, which represents the weight of each edge of the graph. It then iterates over the edges in ascending order of weights (using `sorted()` function), and selects those edges which do not create a cycle. It uses a dictionary `group_by_node` to keep track of the groups of nodes that are currently connected. The function returns a set of edges which together form the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
