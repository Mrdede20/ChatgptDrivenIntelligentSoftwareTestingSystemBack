The above code implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm for searching if the `goalnode` is reachable from the `startnode` in a directed graph.

The Breadth-First Search algorithm starts at the `startnode` and explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving to the next depth. It uses a queue data structure to maintain the nodes to be explored. If the `goalnode` is found, the algorithm returns True, else False. 

The algorithm uses a set to keep track of nodes already seen, to avoid revisiting nodes and getting stuck in an infinite loop. If a node has not been seen before, it is added to the set, and its successors are added to the queue to be explored later. 

Overall, this code can be used to find if there is a path from `startnode` to `goalnode` in a directed graph and it returns True if a path exists and False otherwise.
