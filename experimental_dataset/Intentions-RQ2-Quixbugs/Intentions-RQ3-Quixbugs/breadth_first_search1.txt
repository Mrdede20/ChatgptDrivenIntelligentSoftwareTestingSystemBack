The intention of the code is to implement Breadth-First Search algorithm to determine whether the goalnode is reachable from the startnode in a directed graph. The algorithm works by exploring all the neighbors of the startnode, then the neighbors' neighbors, and so on until it finds the goalnode. It uses a Queue data structure to store the nodes to visit next and a set to keep track of the nodes that have already been seen. If the goalnode is found, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
