The intention of this code is to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' using recursion. GCD is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both 'a' and 'b' without leaving a remainder. The function uses the fact that GCD of 'a' and 'b' is equal to GCD of 'b' and 'a % b', where '%' represents the modulus operator. The function returns the GCD of 'a' and 'b'.
