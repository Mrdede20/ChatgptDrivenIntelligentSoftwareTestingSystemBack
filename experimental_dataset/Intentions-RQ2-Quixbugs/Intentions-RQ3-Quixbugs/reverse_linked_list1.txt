The intention of this code is to reverse a singly linked list. A singly linked list is a data structure composed of a sequence of nodes, in which each node stores a reference to an object, and the successor node in the sequence. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node, but not to the previous node. The reverse_linked_list function takes the head of a singly linked list, iterates through all the nodes, reverses the direction of the successor pointers of each node, and returns the new head of the reversed linked list.
