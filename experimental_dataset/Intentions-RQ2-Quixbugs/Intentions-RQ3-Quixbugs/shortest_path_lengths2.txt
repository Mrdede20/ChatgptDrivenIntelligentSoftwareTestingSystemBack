This code implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. The input consists of the number of nodes in the graph and a dictionary of edge lengths keyed by an ordered pair of node ids. The output is a dictionary containing the shortest path length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm iteratively updates the shortest path between every pair of nodes by considering all possible intermediate nodes. It starts with the shortest path lengths between every pair of nodes being equal to the edge length between them (if there is an edge) or infinity (if there is no edge). It then updates the shortest path lengths by considering the possibility of going through intermediate nodes. This is done using a triple-nested loop, where the outermost loop considers all possible intermediate nodes, the middle loop considers the starting nodes, and the innermost loop considers the ending nodes.

The defaultdict from the collections module is used to set a default value of infinity for any key that does not exist yet in the dictionary holding the length of the shortest paths. This avoids having to initialize the dictionary with all possible pairs of nodes before the algorithm starts.
