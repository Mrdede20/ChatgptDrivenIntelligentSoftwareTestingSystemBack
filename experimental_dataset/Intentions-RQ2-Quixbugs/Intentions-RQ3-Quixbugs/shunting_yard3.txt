The intention of the code is to implement the shunting-yard algorithm to convert the input tokens in infix notation into equivalent Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) which is also known as Postfix Notation. The function accepts a list of tokens in infix notation as input and returns the same tokens reordered into RPN. The function assumes that the input tokens are either integers or arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/). The algorithm uses a stack data structure to achieve the transformation process.
