The intention of the given code is to implement the Depth-first Search algorithm for a directed graph. The algorithm starts from a given start node and tries to reach the goal node by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The algorithm keeps track of the nodes visited to avoid visiting the same node more than once. The output of the function is a boolean value that reflects whether the goal node is reachable from the start node.
