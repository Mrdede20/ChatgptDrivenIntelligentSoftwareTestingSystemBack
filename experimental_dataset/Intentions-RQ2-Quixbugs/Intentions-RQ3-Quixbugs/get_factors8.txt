The intention of the code is to obtain the prime factorization of a given integer `n`. It returns a list of prime factors of `n` in sorted order, including repetition if a prime factor appears more than once. 

The code uses trial division, where it divides `n` successively by all possible integer factors starting from `2` up to the square root of `n`. If an integer factor is found, it recursively finds the factors of the quotient. This process continues until the quotient is 1, returning the list of prime factors found.
