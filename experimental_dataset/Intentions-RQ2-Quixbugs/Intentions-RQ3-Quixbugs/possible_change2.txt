The intention of the following code is to write a Python function that calculates the number of distinct ways to make change for a given total using only coins of the given denominations. The function recursively calculates the possible change by considering the first coin denomination and then recursively calling itself with the remaining coin denominations to see how many ways there are to make change for the remaining total. The total count for each denomination is the sum of the counts for the remaining denominations. The base case for the recursion is when the total becomes zero, which means there's only one way to make change (i.e., using no coins).
