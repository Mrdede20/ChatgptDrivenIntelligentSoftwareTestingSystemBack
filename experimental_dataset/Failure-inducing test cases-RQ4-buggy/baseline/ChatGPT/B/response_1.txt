Test case:

Input:
3
115
cde
97
xyz
97
abc

Expected output:
4
25
1

Actual output:
2
25
1

Explanation:
The expected output for the first input (115 and "cde") is 4, which is correct. However, for the second input (97 and "xyz"), the expected output is 25, but the actual output is 26 (which is off by 1). This is because the program subtracts 96 from the ASCII value of the character, but the correct value to subtract is 96 for lowercase letters and 64 for uppercase letters. Since the program doesn't account for this difference, it produces the wrong output for lowercase letters that have ASCII values greater than 97 (such as 'x' and 'y'). This test case highlights the bug in the program and results in a test failure.
