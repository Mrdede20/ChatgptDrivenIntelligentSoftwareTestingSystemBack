Test case:

Input:
3
97
hello
97
world
97
!

Expected Output:
8
15
2

Actual Output:
8
15
0

Explanation:
The program is supposed to print the highest alphabetical value in each input string, subtracting 96 to get the corresponding value (e.g. "a" - "96" = 1). However, in the third input string "!", the program fails to recognize the value as an alphabetical character, resulting in it printing 0 instead of 2. This is because the conditional statement (`if ord(s[i])>a:`) only checks for values greater than `a`, but not equal to `a`. Fixing the conditional statement to `if ord(s[i])>=a:` would solve the issue.
