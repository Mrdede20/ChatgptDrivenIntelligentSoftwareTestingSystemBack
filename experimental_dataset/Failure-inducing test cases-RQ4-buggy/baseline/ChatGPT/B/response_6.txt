Test case:

Input:
3
98
abc
101
def
104
ghi

Expected output:
2
5
8

Actual output:
1
5
8

Explanation:
The actual output of the first test case is incorrect. It should be 2 because the character with the highest ASCII value in the string "abc" is 'c', which has an ASCII value of 99. Therefore, a should take the value of 99 and the output should be 99 - 96 = 3. However, the program output 1 instead, indicating a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
