Test case:

Input:
3
101
abc
102
def
103
ghi

Expected Output:
3
4
5

Actual Output:
1
2
3

Explanation:
The program failed to correctly identify the maximum character value in the input string, resulting in incorrect output. This is because the program only considers ASCII codes greater than the initial value of 'a', which is 97. However, in the input string "abc", the character 'a' has an ASCII code of 97, which is not greater than the initial value of 'a', causing it to be ignored in the character comparison. This leads to an incorrect maximum value being stored in 'a', resulting in incorrect output.
