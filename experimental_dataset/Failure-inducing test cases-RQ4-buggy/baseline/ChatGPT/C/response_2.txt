Test case:

Input:
1
5
5 4 6 2 8

Expected output:
2 1 3 5 6

Actual output:
2 1 3 6 5

Explanation:
The program is supposed to find the two largest numbers in the given list of integers and print the absolute differences between each number and the second largest number. In this test case, the second largest number is 6 and the absolute differences should be [2, 1, 3, 5, 6]. However, due to a bug in the code, the second largest number is incorrectly identified as 5 instead of 6, causing the program to produce the incorrect output of [2, 1, 3, 6, 5]. Therefore, the test fails to meet the expected output.
