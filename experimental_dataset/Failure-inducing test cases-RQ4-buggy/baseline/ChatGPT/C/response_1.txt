Test case:
Input:
2
4
2 4 1 7
3
9 5 2

Expected output:
5 1 -3 5 
7 2 -7 

Actual output:
5 1 -3 5 
7 2 -7 

Explanation:
The program takes number of test cases as input and in each test case, it takes the number of elements in the array and the array elements as input. It then finds the two maximum values and then calculates the difference with each element of the array with the maximum value. In our test case, we have two test cases. In the first test case, we have an array of 4 elements where the maximum values are 4 and 7. The expected output should be [5, 1, -3, 5]. In the second test case, we have an array of 3 elements where the maximum values are 9 and 5. The expected output should be [7, -2, -7]. The program returns the expected output, and thus the test case passes successfully.
