Test case:

Input:
2
5
10 5 7 8 6
3
1 2 0

Expected Output:
5 3 -3 -2 -4
1 1 -2

Actual Output:
5 3 -3 -2 -4
1 1 1

Explanation:
In the second test case, the output should be 1 1 -2. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1 1 1. This is because the program is not properly updating the second maximum value of the list. The bug occurs in the line "if s[i]>=s[mx[1]]:", where it should be "if s[mx[0]] > s[i] > s[mx[1]]:". The bug causes the program to incorrectly select the second maximum value, which leads to incorrect output.
