Test case:

Input:
4
5 2 9
1 8 3
7 4 6
2 10 1

Expected Output:
5
3
6
2

Actual Output:
5
3
6

Explanation:
The program is designed to take 't' number of test cases as input and print the middle number of the 3 integers entered for each test case. In this particular test case, the expected output is generated by taking the second largest number from each set of 3 integers. However, the program has only iterated through 3 test cases (as opposed to 4) before terminating due to the faulty while loop condition (which requires 't' to be greater than 1, instead of greater than or equal to 1). This results in the program prematurely terminating before providing the output for the last test case (2, 10, 1), causing a test failure.
