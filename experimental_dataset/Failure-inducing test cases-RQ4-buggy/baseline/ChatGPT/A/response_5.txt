Test case:
t=2
Input:
5 4 3
2 8 1
0 9 7
4 1 10
8 3 5
Expected Output:
4
2
7
4
8
3
Actual Output:
4
2
7
1
8
3
Explanation:
The program did not output the second largest number in the third input set due to a bug in the sorting algorithm. It sorted the numbers in ascending order instead of descending order, causing it to output the wrong value. This resulted in a test failure as the expected output did not match the actual output.
