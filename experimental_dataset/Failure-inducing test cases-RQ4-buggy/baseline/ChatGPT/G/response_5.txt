Test Case:

Input:
2
5 1 5
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 1 1
1 2 1
1 3 2
2 4 3
3 5 4
1 3

Expected Output:
NO
YES

Explanation:
The program checks whether there are two paths from a point A to B, each with an even XOR sum of weights. In the first input, there is only one path from point 1 to point 5, with an odd XOR sum of weights (1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 0b10). Therefore, the program should output "NO". In the second input, there are two paths from point 1 to point 3, each with an even XOR sum of weights (1 XOR 2 = 0b11 and 1 XOR 4 = 0b101). Therefore, the program should output "YES".
