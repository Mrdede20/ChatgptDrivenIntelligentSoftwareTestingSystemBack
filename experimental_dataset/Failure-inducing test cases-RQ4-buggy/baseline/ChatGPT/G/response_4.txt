Test Case:

Input:
1
4 1 4
1 2 10
2 3 10
2 4 1

Expected Output:
YES

Explanation:
The graph has two central nodes: 2 and 3, with equal shortest distances to nodes 1 and 4. 
When traversing from node a=1 to node b=4, there are two possible paths: 1-2-4 or 1-2-3-4, both with XOR distance 11. 
Thus, set(fromA) and set(fromB) will have more than one common element.
The program should output YES, but it will not due to the incorrect check implemented in line 25.
