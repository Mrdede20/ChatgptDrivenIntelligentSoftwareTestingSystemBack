Test Case:

Input: 

1
5 1 5
1 2 3
1 3 4
2 4 2
2 5 5

Expected Output:

YES

Explanation:

In the given program, we need to find if there is any path from node a to node b that has even XOR sum of weights of all its edges. 

Let's consider the input graph:

    1 --3-- 2 --2-- 4
    |           |
    4           5
    
We need to find if there is any even XOR sum path from node 1 to node 5.

From node 1, we can reach node 2 with XOR sum 3. From node 2, we can reach node 5 with XOR sum 2. So, the total XOR sum of this path is 3^2=1, which is an odd number.

Now, let's remove the edge (2,5) and check again:

    1 --3-- 2 --2-- 4
    |           
    4           
    
Now, we need to find if there is any even XOR sum path from node 1 to node 4.

From node 1, we can reach node 2 with XOR sum 3. From node 2, we can reach node 4 with XOR sum 2. So, the total XOR sum of this path is 3^2=1, which is an odd number.

Hence, the expected output is YES.

Actual Output:

NO

Explanation:

The program is failing to identify the even XOR sum path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph, which should have resulted in "YES". So, the test case has triggered a bug in the program and resulted in test failure.
