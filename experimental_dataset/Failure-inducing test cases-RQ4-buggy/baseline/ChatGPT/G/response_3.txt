Test case:

Input:
1
5 1 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 4 3
4 5 1

Expected output:
YES

Explanation:
The graph formed by the input has two paths from node 1 to node 5, one that goes through node 2 and one that goes through nodes 4 and 5. Both paths have the same XOR sum, which is 3. Therefore, both paths satisfy the condition fromA[x]^fromB[x]=pathXor for all nodes x in the graph. This will trigger the bug that fails to detect multiple valid paths and results in a wrong output of YES instead of NO.
