Test case:
t=1
n=4
a=1
b=4
1 2 3
1 3 4
3 4 5
Expected output: YES
Explanation: There are multiple paths from node 1 to node 4 with different XOR values. The program is supposed to output "YES" in such cases, however, it will output "NO" because the variable "j" in line 14 is not reset to 0 before the second BFS traversal, causing it to contain incorrect values which results in incorrect output.
