Test Case:

Input:
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
2 3 3

Expected Output:
YES

Explanation: 
The code checks if there are two paths from node A to node B that have an even XOR sum distance. In this test case, there are two paths: 1-2-3 and 1-2-3. Both have an XOR sum distance of 0. Thus, the output should be YES.

However, the code has a bug. It assumes that every node is reachable from both A and B, which is not always the case. In this test case, node 3 is not reachable from node A. As a result, the program outputs NO, which is incorrect. 

Actual Output:
NO

To fix the bug, the code should first check if the nodes are reachable from A and B before checking for the XOR sum distance condition.
