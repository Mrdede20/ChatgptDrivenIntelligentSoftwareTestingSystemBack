Test Case:
Input:
2
4 1 4
1 2 3
1 3 4
3 4 5
4 1 3
1 2 3
1 3 4
3 4 5
Expected Output:
YES
YES
Explanation:
The program is trying to find if there are multiple paths between nodes `a` and `b` such that the xor sum of the weights on that path is even. The above input is chosen such that there are two such paths from node `1` to `4`, namely `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Both of them have even xor sum of weights. Hence the expected output is "YES" for both the test cases.
