Test case:
t=1
n=3
a=0
b=1
1 2 1
1 3 2

This test case has a graph with 3 nodes and two edges with weights. The source node is 0 and the destination node is 1. This should output "YES" as the path from A to B can be either 0-1 or 0-2-1, and both have a XOR value of 2. However, the program may fail to handle the case where the queue is initialized with (-1,0) for all nodes, resulting in the incorrect value being stored for some nodes in the queue. This will result in a wrong answer being outputted, causing the test case to fail.
