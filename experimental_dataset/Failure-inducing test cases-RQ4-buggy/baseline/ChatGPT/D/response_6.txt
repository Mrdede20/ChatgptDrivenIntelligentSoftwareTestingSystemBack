2. Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] represents a mountain throughout the list. The function should return 'NO' but it returns 'YES'.
3. Input [4, 2, 5, 1, 3] has two contenders (valleys that meet the conditions of having higher elevation on both sides). The function should return 'YES' but it returns 'NO'.
4. Input [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] has a single valley that does not meet the conditions of a contender. The function should return 'NO' but it returns 'YES'.
5. Input [5] represents a trivial win. The function should return 'YES' but it returns 'NO'.
