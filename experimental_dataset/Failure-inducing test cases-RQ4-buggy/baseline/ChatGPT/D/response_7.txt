Bug description:
The program is designed to determine if it is possible to remove at most one element from a list of integers in such a way that the remaining elements form a "mountain" shape (i.e., increasing and then decreasing). However, the program fails to correctly identify some cases where this is not possible.
The bug occurs when there are two valleys (i.e., decreasing sequences) in the input list that do not overlap or share a common boundary. In such cases, the program incorrectly identifies the first valley as a candidate for removal, even if removing it would not result in a mountain shape. This occurs because the program checks if the first valley satisfies certain conditions, but does not check the second valley at all.
In the provided test case, the input lists are chosen to demonstrate this bug. Specifically:
- Input 1: There are two valleys ([1, 2, 3] and [2, 1]), which do not overlap or share a common boundary. The program incorrectly identifies the first valley as a candidate for removal, even though removing it would leave a non-mountain shape ([1, 3, 2, 1]).
- Input 3: There are two valleys ([1, 2, 3] and [2, 2]), which do not overlap or share a common boundary. Again, the program incorrectly identifies the first valley as a candidate for removal, even though removing it would leave a non-mountain shape ([1, 3, 2, 2]).
- Input 4: There are two valleys ([1, 2, 2] and [2, 1]), which do not overlap or share a common boundary. In this case, removing either valley would result in a non-mountain shape. However, the program incorrectly identifies the first valley as a candidate for removal, even though removing it would leave a non-mountain shape ([1, 2, 1]).
To fix the bug, the program should be modified to consider all valleys in the input list, and only return "YES" if there is exactly one valley that can be removed to form a mountain shape. If there are multiple valleys that could be removed, or no valleys, the program should return "NO".
