Test case:

Input:

1 2 3 2 1
5
1 2 3 2 3
5
1 2 3 3 2
5
2 3 2 1 1
5
2 3 2 3 1

Expected output:
NO
YES
YES
NO
YES

Explanation:
The function solves a problem where given a list of integers, you need to check if there is a single "valley" (sequence of integers where every adjacent pair is in strictly increasing order, followed by strictly decreasing order) that contains all the integers in the list. If such a valley exists, the function returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

In the first test case, the input list is "1 2 3 2 1", which has two valleys: "1 2 3 2" and "2 1". However, neither of these valleys contains all the integers in the list, so the expected output is "NO".

In the second test case, the input list is "1 2 3 2 3", which has a single valley "1 2 3 2 3" that contains all the integers in the list, so the expected output is "YES".

The third and fifth test cases are similar to the second, also having a single valley that contains all the integers in the list, resulting in "YES".

In the forth test case, the input list is "2 3 2 1 1", which has two valleys: "2 3 2" and "1 1". Although the first valley contains all the integers in the list, it is not a single valley, so the expected output is "NO".
