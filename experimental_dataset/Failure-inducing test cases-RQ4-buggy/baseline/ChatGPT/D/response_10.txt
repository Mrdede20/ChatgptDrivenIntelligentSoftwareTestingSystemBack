Explanation: 

1. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], Output: YES (Expected Output)
   There are no valleys in the input, hence it is possible to win.
2. Input: [4, 3, 2, 1], Output: NO (Expected Output)
   The valley in the input array is not accompanied by a higher point on both sides, hence it is not possible to win.
3. Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], Output: YES (Expected Output)
   The valley in the input array is accompanied by higher points on both sides, hence it is possible to win.
4. Input: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], Output: NO (Expected Output)
   The first valley in the input array is not accompanied by a higher point on both sides, hence it is not possible to win.
5. Input: [1, 1, 1], Output: NO (Expected Output)
   There are no valleys in the input, hence it is not possible to win.
