Test case:

Input:
4
5
1 2 3 2 1
6
1 2 3 3 2 1
4
1 2 1 2
2
1 2

Expected Output:
NO
YES
NO
YES

Explanation:
- For the first input, the program should return NO since there are two possibles valleys (1-3 and 3-5) and both of them are invalid to win the game.
- For the second input, the program should return YES since the valley 1-3 is a valid option to win the game.
- For the third input, the program should return NO since there is only one valley (1-2) and it is not a valid option to win the game.
- For the fourth input, the program should return YES since there are no valleys and a trivial win is possible.
