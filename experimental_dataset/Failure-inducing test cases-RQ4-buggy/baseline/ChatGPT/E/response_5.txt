Test Case:

Input:
4
5
1 0 0 1 0
6
0 1 1 0 1 1
3
1 1 0
8
1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Expected Output:
6
6
0
12

However, the program is expected to fail for the second test case where the input bits are [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. The expected output is 6 but the program will return 5. The bug is in the line where first Sum and second Sum is calculated, the counting of zeros in the list should not reset to 0 every time 1 is found as the program counts the number of inversions that can be made in the list based on the number of zeros that occur before encountering a 1. The zero count should be incremented by 1 whenever the binary number in the list is 0 in order to calculate the total number of inversions.
