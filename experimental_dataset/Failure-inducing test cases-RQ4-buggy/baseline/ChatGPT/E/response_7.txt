Test Case:
Input:
3
4
0 1 0 1
5
1 1 0 1 0
6
1 0 1 0 1 0

Expected Output:
4
3
9

Bug:
The program does not pass the test case where the input bits have only 0's or 1's. It tries to modify the bits to generate the first and second binary numbers by flipping the least significant 0 to 1 for the first number and the least significant 1 to 0 for the second number. If the bits have only 0's or 1's, it will not be able to satisfy both conditions to generate valid binary numbers resulting in wrong output. 

Test Result:
The output generated by the program for the above test case is:
4
3
0

The program passed the first two test cases but failed the third test case. Hence the bug is triggered by the third test case and the program has failed to generate the correct output.
