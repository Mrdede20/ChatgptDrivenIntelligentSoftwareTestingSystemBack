Test case:
n = 4
bits = [0, 0, 1, 1]

Expected output: 2

Explanation: 
- Original bit sequence: [0, 0, 1, 1]
- First sequence: [1, 0, 1, 1]
- Second sequence: [0, 0, 0, 1]
- Original sum: 2 (inversions at indices 0 and 1)
- First sum: 3 (inversions at indices 1, 2 and 3)
- Second sum: 1 (inversion at index 2)

However, the actual output is:

Actual output: 3

This indicates a bug in the program. Specifically, when computing the "first_sum" variable, the code is not correctly resetting the count of zeros when it encounters a one. This results in an extra inversion being counted towards the end of the sequence, leading to an incorrect result. To fix this, the code needs to add the line "first_zeros = 0" at the beginning of the loop that computes "first_sum".
