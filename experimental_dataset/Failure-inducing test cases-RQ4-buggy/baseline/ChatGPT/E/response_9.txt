Test Case:

Input:
3
5
0 1 0 1 0
3
1 0 1
4
0 0 1 0

Expected Output:
7
1
1

Explanation:
In this program, the BinaryInversions method takes an integer n which represents the number of bits and a list called bits which contains 'n' binary values (0 or 1). The method returns the maximum number of inversions possible by either flipping 0s to 1s or flipping 1s to 0s.

For the first test case, the maximum inversions can be achieved by flipping the first 0 to 1 and the last 1 to 0 which would result in bits becoming [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This results in a total of 7 inversions: (1+3) + (2) + (1+3) = 7.

For the second test case, there is only one inversion possible by flipping the 0 to 1. Thus the method should return 1.

For the third test case, again the maximum inversions can be achieved by flipping the first 0 to 1 which would result in bits becoming [1, 0, 1, 0]. This results in a total of 1 inversion: (1) + (1) = 1.

If the program fails to return the expected output for any of the above test cases, it indicates a bug in the BinaryInversions method and a test failure.
