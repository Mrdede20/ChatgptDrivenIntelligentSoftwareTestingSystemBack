Test case: 

Input: 

2 (number of test cases)

4 (length of bit array)

0 1 0 1 (bit array)

5 (length of bit array)

1 0 0 1 1 (bit array)

Expected output: 

4  (for the first test case)

6  (for the second test case)

Explanation: 

In the first case, the array can be modified to [1,1,0,1] or [1,1,1,1] to get the maximum number of inversions. However, the program returns 2 as the output.

In the second case, the array can be modified to [1,1,0,0,0] or [1,0,0,0,0] to get the maximum number of inversions. However, the program returns 2 as the output.
