Test Case:
n=5
bits=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

Expected Output: 6

Explanation: 
- The original list has 4 inversions (0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 1-0)
- The first list (after changing the first 0 to 1) has 6 inversions (0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 1-0, 1-0, 1-0)
- The second list (after changing the last 1 to 0) has 7 inversions (0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 1-0, 1-0, 1-0, 1-0)

However, running the test case in the program above results in test failure as it returns the output of the original list (4) instead of the expected output (6).
