Test case:

Input:
2
4 9 2
5 2 1 3
5 10 2
5 2 1 3 4

Expected Output:
1
Impossible

Explanation:
For the first test case, the initial sorting of the list A in descending order becomes [5, 3, 2, 1]. Then, the sum of the first d elements of A (where d=2) is 5+3=8, which is less than c=9. Since the product of the maximum element in A (which is 5) and d (which is 2) is also less than c, the program enters the while loop to search for the maximum value of mid such that the corresponding coins is less than c. On the second iteration of the loop, mid is set to 2, and the selecsum becomes 5+3+2=10, which multiplied by numselec=1 is still less than c. However, when remain is set to 1, the corresponding sum of A becomes 5, which when added to the previous selecsum, gives coins=15. Since coins is greater than or equal to c, the program sets l=mid=2 and exits the loop. Finally, the program outputs mid-1=1, which is the correct answer.

For the second test case, the initial sorting of the list A in descending order becomes [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Then, the sum of the first d elements of A (where d=2) is 5+4=9, which is equal to c. However, the product of the maximum element in A (which is 5) and d (which is 2) is less than c, so the program enters the while loop to search for the maximum value of mid such that the corresponding coins is less than c. On the second iteration of the loop, mid is set to 2, and the selecsum becomes 5+4+3=12, which multiplied by numselec=1 is still greater than c. Therefore, l is set to mid-1=1, which means that the next iteration of the loop will exit immediately since l=r. Finally, the program outputs mid-1=1, which should be "Impossible" instead of 1.
