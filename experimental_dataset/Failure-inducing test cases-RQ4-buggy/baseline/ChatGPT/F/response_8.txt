Test case:

Input:
3
3 7 2
2 3 4
4 10 3
2 4 6 8
4 9 2
1 2 3 4

Expected Output:
2
Impossible
Infinity

Explanation:
For the first input, we have:
n=3, c=7, d=2 and A=[2, 3, 4]
After sorting A and selecting the first d (which is 2) elements, we get the list [4, 3].
Then, we calculate the sum of the selected elements (which is 7) and compare it to c. Since it is equal, we expect the output to be "Infinity".

For the second input, we have:
n=4, c=10, d=3 and A=[2, 4, 6, 8]
After sorting A, we get the list [8, 6, 4, 2].
Then, we check if the largest element (which is 8) can be selected d times to obtain a sum greater than or equal to c. Since it is not, we expect the output to be "Impossible".

For the third input, we have:
n=4, c=9, d=2 and A=[1, 2, 3, 4]
After sorting A and selecting the first d (which is 2) elements, we get the list [4, 3].
Then, we use binary search to find the largest possible number of elements we can select from A to obtain a sum greater than or equal to c.
In this case, we can select 2 elements (which is the first and second largest elements of A) to obtain a sum of 7. Therefore, we expect the output to be 1 (since we selected two elements).
