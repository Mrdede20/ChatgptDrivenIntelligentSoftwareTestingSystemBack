Test case:

Input:
3
3 9 2
5 2 2
5 12 2
5 5 5 5 5
5 15 2
5 5 5 5 5

Expected output:
1
Infinity
Impossible

Explanation:
For the first query, we have coins with values [5, 2, 2] and we need to select 2 coins with the highest values that sum up to a total of at least 9 coins. The coins that we select are [5, 2], and their sum equals 7 coins. Therefore, we cannot get the desired number of coins, and the program outputs 1 as the maximum number of coins we can obtain.

For the second query, the sum of all coins exceeds the number of coins we require, and thus the program outputs Infinity.

For the third query, the highest value coin is worth 5 coins and we need to select 2 coins with a total value of at least 15 coins. Since the highest value coin cannot be used any further, we cannot obtain the required number of coins and the program outputs Impossible.
