Test case:
Input:
3
4 8 2
3 2 1 1
3 7 2
2 2 2
2 7 1
3 2

Expected output:
1
Impossible
2

Explanation:
For the first query, we have n=4, c=8, and d=2, with A=[3, 2, 1, 1]. The initial sort gives us A=[3, 2, 1, 1]. Since the sum of the first two values in A is greater than or equal to c, the program should output "Infinity". However, the program output is 0, resulting in a test failure.

For the second query, we have n=3, c=7, and d=2, with A=[2, 2, 2]. The sort gives us A=[2, 2, 2]. Since the maximum value in A multiplied by d (which is 2) is less than c, the program should output "Impossible". However, the program output is 1, resulting in a test failure.

For the third query, we have n=2, c=7, and d=1, with A=[3, 2]. The sort gives us A=[3, 2]. The binary search in the program should find that the minimum number of elements required to sum up to c is 2, and therefore output 1 (which is the value of (mid-1) in the program). The expected output is 2, however, since the program is using "mid-1" instead of "mid". This results in a test failure.
