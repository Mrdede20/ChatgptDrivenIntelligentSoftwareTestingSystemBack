Test Case: 

Input:
3
5 9 3
2 3 4 5 6
5 20 2
5 5 5 5 5
5 8 2
1 1 1 1 10

Expected Output:
1
Infinity
0

Actual Output:
1
Impossible
0

Bug Description: 
The bug in the code is in the condition `elif A[0]*d<c:`. This condition is incorrect as it assumes that the maximum possible coins that can be obtained is by selecting the first element of the sorted list A d times. However, this is not always true as the sum of d elements from A can be greater than A[0]*d. This can result in a situation where the condition is false even though it should be true, leading to a wrong output. In our test case, the sum of elements in the second input is 25, which is greater than 5*5=25. Therefore, the correct output for the second input should be "Infinity" instead of "Impossible".
