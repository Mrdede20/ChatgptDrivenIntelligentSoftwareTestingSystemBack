Test Case:
Input:
1
3 10 2
3 2 1

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
1

Explanation:
The program is supposed to minimize the sum of top `d` elements of the array `A`. In this test case, `n` is equal to 3, `c` is equal to 10, and `d` is equal to 2. The array `A` is [3, 2, 1].

Initially, the program sorts the array `A` in decreasing order: [3, 2, 1]. Since the sum of the top `d` elements of `A` is greater than or equal to `c` (i.e., 5 >= 10), the program should print "Infinity". However, there is an error in the condition on line 5 of the program: `if sum(A[:d])>=c:` should be `if sum(A[:d])>=c and d<n:`. This ensures that there are enough elements in the array to select from. Otherwise, the program should print "Impossible".

Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 1 instead of "Infinity".
