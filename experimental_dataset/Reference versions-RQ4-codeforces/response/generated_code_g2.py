Program 1 and Program 2 both have a helper function `bfs` which uses Breadth-First Search to find all the paths from a given start node to all other nodes in the graph. 

The main function `find_two_paths_with_same_xor_sum` takes in the number of test cases and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of nodes in the graph, the source and destination nodes, and a list of the edges in the graph. 

Both programs convert the edges into a dictionary representation of the graph using a defaultdict. They then use `bfs` to find all the paths from the source and destination nodes to all other nodes in the graph. 

Program 1 calculates the XOR sum of each path separately, by iterating through all the paths from node `a` to each node and all the paths from node `b` to each node. These are stored in a dictionary `xor_sums`. If there are any values in `xor_sums` with a count greater than 1, it indicates that there are at least two paths with the same XOR sum of edge weights. 

Program 2 calculates the XOR sum directly by iterating through all the paths from each node to itself and summing up the edge weights for both `a` and `b`. It then appends the XOR sum to a list `xor_sums`. This list of XOR sums is then checked for any values that have a count greater than 1, indicating at least two paths with the same XOR sum. 

Both programs return a list of "YES" or "NO" strings, depending on whether there exist two distinct paths between 'a' and 'b' with the same XOR sum of edge weights.
