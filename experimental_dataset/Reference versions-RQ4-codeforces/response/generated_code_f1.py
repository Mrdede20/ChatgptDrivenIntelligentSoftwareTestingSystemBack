First program:

```
def max_integer_k(n, values):
    for i in range(n):
        lst = values[i][0]
        c = values[i][1]
        d = values[i][2]
        lst.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if sum(lst[:d]) >= c:
            print("Infinity")
        elif lst[0]*d < c:
            print("Impossible")
        else:
            low = d
            high = len(lst)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if sum(lst[:mid]) >= c*d:
                    high = mid
                else:
                    low = mid + 1
            print(low-1)
```

Second program:

```
def max_integer_k(n, values):
    for i in range(n):
        lst = values[i][0]
        c = values[i][1]
        d = values[i][2]
        lst.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if sum(lst[:d]) >= c:
            print("Infinity")
        elif lst[0]*d < c:
            print("Impossible")
        else:
            k = 0
            for j in range(d, len(lst)+1):
                if sum(lst[:j]) >= c*d:
                    k = j
            print(k-1)
```

Both programs take in an integer n and a list of tuples containing three integers in each tuple (the list A, c, and d). They iterate over the list of test cases, sorts the list A in descending order, and implements one of three outcomes based on the given constraints. If the sum of the first d integers in the sorted A list is greater than or equal to c, then it prints "Infinity". If the product of the first integer in the sorted A list and integer d is less than c, then it prints "Impossible". Otherwise, program 1 implements binary search while program 2 iterates through the list to find the maximum integer k.

Program 1 is more optimized as it uses binary search to find the maximum integer k with O(log n) time complexity, while program 2 has a time complexity of O(n^2) as it iterates through the list to find the maximum integer k.
