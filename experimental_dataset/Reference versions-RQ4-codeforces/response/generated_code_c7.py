Program 1:

```
def find_diff(t: int, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
  result = []
  for i in range(t):
    n, s = test_cases[i]
    max1 = max2 = s[0]
    for j in range(1, n):
      if s[j] > max1:
        max2 = max1
        max1 = s[j]
      elif s[j] > max2:
        max2 = s[j]
    temp = []
    for j in range(n):
      if s[j] == max1:
        temp.append(abs(max2 - s[j]))
      else:
        temp.append(abs(max1 - s[j]))
    result.append(temp)
  return result
```

Program 2:

```
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_diff(t: int, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, s = test_cases[i]
        sorted_array = sorted(s,reverse=True)
        max1 = sorted_array[0]
        max2 = sorted_array[1]
        temp = []
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] == max1:
                temp.append(abs(max2 - s[j]))
            else:
                temp.append(abs(max1 - s[j]))
        result.append(temp)
    return result
```

Both programs take the same inputs, t and test_cases, and return a list of lists containing the resulting list for each test case.

The first program finds the two maximum values in the array using a for loop and if statements. It then uses another for loop to iterate through each value in the array and calculate the difference from the two maximum values one by one.

The second program sorts the array in descending order and then finds the two maximum values by accessing the first two elements of the sorted array. It then uses another for loop to calculate the difference from the two maximum values one by one.

Both programs achieve the same result, but the second program is more efficient as it uses the built-in Python function sorted() to sort the array in descending order, which has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)). The first program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested for loops used to find the maximum values.
