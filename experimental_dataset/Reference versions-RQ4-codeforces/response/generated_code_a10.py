Sure, here are two programs that achieve the intended functionality using the same method name and parameter type:

First Program:
```python
def second_smallest(t: int) -> None:
    for i in range(t):
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[1])
```

Second Program:
```python
def second_smallest(t: int) -> None:
    while t > 0:
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[1])
        t -= 1
``` 

Both programs utilize the same function name `second_smallest` with a single parameter of type `int` named `t`. 

The first program uses a `for` loop to iterate through `t` test cases. In each iteration, it reads in three integers as input, sorts them in ascending order, and then prints the second smallest integer of that set of inputs. 

The second program utilizes a `while` loop to perform the same functionality. Each iteration reads in three integers as input, sorts them in ascending order, prints the second smallest value, and decrements the loop variable `t` by 1.

Both programs should fulfill the intended functionality as outlined in the original prompt.
