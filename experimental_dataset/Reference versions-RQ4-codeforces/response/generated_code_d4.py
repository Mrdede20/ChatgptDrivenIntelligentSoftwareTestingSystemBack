Program 1:

```python
from typing import List

def valleys_exist(towers: List[int]) -> str:
    valleys = []
    for i in range(1, len(towers)-1):
        if towers[i-1] > towers[i] < towers[i+1]:
            j = i-1
            while j >= 0 and towers[j] > towers[j+1]:
                j -= 1
            k = i+1
            while k < len(towers) and towers[k] > towers[k-1]:
                k += 1
            valleys.append((j+1, k-1))
    for i in range(len(valleys)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(valleys)):
            if set(range(*valleys[i])) & set(range(*valleys[j])):
                return "YES"
    return "NO"
```

Program 2:

```python
from typing import List

def valleys_exist(towers: List[int]) -> str:
    valleys = []
    for i in range(1, len(towers)-1):
        if towers[i-1] > towers[i] < towers[i+1]:
            j = i-1
            while j >= 0 and towers[j] > towers[j+1]:
                j -= 1
            k = i+1
            while k < len(towers) and towers[k] > towers[k-1]:
                k += 1
            valleys.append((j+1, k-1))
    for i, valley1 in enumerate(valleys):
        for valley2 in valleys[i+1:]:
            if set(range(*valley1)) & set(range(*valley2)):
                return "YES"
    return "NO"
```

Both these programs take in a list of integers `towers` as input, which represents the heights of some towers. The `valleys_exist` function checks if there is a pair of valleys that contain all the towers. A valley is defined as a sequence of decreasing heights. If there is indeed such a pair, the function returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO". The `valleys` list stores the indices of the start and end of each valley. The first program checks if any pair of valleys share any common towers using the `set` intersection operation. In the second program, we employ `enumerate` to iterate over `valleys` list, and compare the current valley with every other valley that follows it in the list.
