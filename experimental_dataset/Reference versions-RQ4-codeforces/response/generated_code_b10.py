Here are two possible solutions to achieve the same intent:

Solution 1:
```
def calc_alphabetical_position(N: int, tests: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(N):
        highest_ascii = 0
        integer, test_str = tests[i]
        for char in test_str:
            if ord(char) > integer:
                integer = ord(char)
        result.append(integer - 96)
    return result
```

Solution 2:
```
def calc_alphabetical_position(N: int, tests: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(N):
        integer, test_str = tests[i]
        highest_char_pos = max([ord(char) for char in test_str if ord(char) > integer]) - 96
        result.append(highest_char_pos)
    return result
```

Both solutions take the same input parameters: an integer N and a list of tuples where each tuple represents a test case and consists of an integer and a string. The output is a list of integers representing the alphabetical positions of the highest characters in each test case.

Solution 1 loops through each character in the string and compares its ASCII value to the given integer. If the ASCII value is higher than the integer, the integer is updated to the ASCII value. Finally, the code appends the difference between the highest ASCII value and 96 to the result list.

Solution 2 uses a list comprehension to create a list of the ASCII values of all characters in the string that are higher than the given integer. The max() function is then used to find the highest value in that list, and the alphabetical position is calculated by subtracting 96. The code appends the result to the result list and moves on to the next test case.
