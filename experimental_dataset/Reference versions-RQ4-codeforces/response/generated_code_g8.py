Here are two programs that achieve the intention:

Program 1:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque


def search_nodes(graph, start, end):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    while queue:
        node, dist = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return visited
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, dist+1))
    return set()


def solution(graph, a, b):
    nodes_a_to_b = search_nodes(graph, a, b)
    nodes_b_to_a = search_nodes(graph, b, a)
    common_nodes = nodes_a_to_b.intersection(nodes_b_to_a)
    if len(common_nodes) >= 2 or len(nodes_b_to_a) > 2:
        return True
    return False

```

Program 2:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque


def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)
    return visited


def solution(graph, a, b):
    nodes_a_to_b = bfs(graph, a)
    nodes_b_to_a = bfs(graph, b)
    common_nodes = nodes_a_to_b.intersection(nodes_b_to_a)
    if len(common_nodes) >= 2 or len(nodes_b_to_a) > 2:
        return True
    return False

```

Both programs use the same method name `solution` and the same parameter type `graph`, `a`, and `b`. The first program uses a modified BFS search algorithm to find the nodes accessed from point `a` up to node `b` and nodes accessed from `b` to point `a`. The second program uses a traditional BFS algorithm to find the nodes accessed from point `a` up to node `b` and nodes accessed from `b` to point `a`. Both programs check whether there are at least two nodes that are common to both sets or if there are more than two nodes visited from `b`. The first program returns the boolean value `True` or `False` while the second program returns the set of common nodes (if any).
