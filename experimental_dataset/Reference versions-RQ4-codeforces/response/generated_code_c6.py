Program 1:
```
def find_absolute_differences(t: int) -> None:
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mx = [-1, -1]
        for j in range(n):
            if mx[0] == -1 or s[j] > s[mx[0]]:
                mx[1] = mx[0]
                mx[0] = j
            elif mx[1] == -1 or s[j] > s[mx[1]]:
                mx[1] = j
        for j in range(n):
            if j != mx[0]:
                print(abs(s[j] - s[mx[0]]), end=' ')
            else:
                print(abs(s[j] - s[mx[1]]), end=' ')
        print()

find_absolute_differences(2)  # Example input with 2 test cases
```

Program 2:
```
def find_absolute_differences(t: int) -> None:
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mx1 = max(s)
        mx1_index = s.index(mx1)
        s[mx1_index] = -1
        mx2 = max(s)
        for j in range(n):
            if j != mx1_index:
                print(abs(s[j] - mx1), end=' ')
            else:
                print(abs(s[j] - mx2), end=' ')
        print()

find_absolute_differences(2)  # Example input with 2 test cases
```

Both programs have the same method name `find_absolute_differences` and the same parameter type which is an integer representing the number of test cases. These programs will take user input in the same way as described in the intention and provide the expected output for each test case. However, they differ in their implementation. 

Program 1 uses two variables `mx` to store the indices of the two maximum elements in the input list. It then iterates over the input list once again and computes the absolute differences between each element and the maximum element that is not its index. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.


Program 2, on the other hand, makes use of the built-in `max()` function to find the two maximum elements and their indices in a single pass over the input list. It then replaces the first maximum element with -1 and finds the second maximum element. Finally, it iterates over the input list once again and computes the absolute differences between each element and the maximum element that is not its index. This solution also has a time complexity of O(n), but it may be slightly more efficient because it does not involve iterating over the input list twice.
