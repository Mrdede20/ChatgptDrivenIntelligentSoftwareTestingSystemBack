Sure! Here's an example implementation of the function `has_non_trivial_valleys`:

### Program 1
```python
def has_non_trivial_valleys(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if seq[i-1] > seq[i] < seq[i+1]:
            for j in range(i+2, n):
                if seq[j-1] > seq[j]:
                    return "YES"
            return "NO"
    return "NO"
```

In the above program, we first initialize `n` as the length of the given sequence. Then, we loop through each element in the sequence except for the first and last elements. We check if the previous and next elements are greater than the current element. If they are, then the current element is a potential candidate for being the start of a non-trivial valley. We then loop through the remaining elements in the sequence and check if any of them are smaller than the current element, and also smaller than their previous element. If we find such an element, then we have a non-trivial valley and return "YES". If we loop through all the elements and don't find any non-trivial valleys, then we return "NO".

### Program 2
```python
def has_non_trivial_valleys(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    valleys = []
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if seq[i-1] > seq[i] < seq[i+1]:
            valleys.append(i)
    for v in valleys:
        for j in range(v+2, n):
            if seq[j-1] > seq[j]:
                return "YES"
    return "NO"
```

In this program, we follow a similar approach to the first program. However, instead of immediately returning "YES" if we find a non-trivial valley, we append the index of the potential start of the valley to a list. We then loop through all the indices in this list and check if there are any elements in the sequence after the valley that are smaller than the valley and smaller than their previous element. If we find such an element, then we have a non-trivial valley and return "YES". If we loop through all the indices and don't find any non-trivial valleys, then we return "NO".
