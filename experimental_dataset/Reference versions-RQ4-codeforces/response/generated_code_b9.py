Here's one way to solve this problem using the method name `find_ascii_difference`:

**Program 1:**

```python
def find_ascii_difference(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        a, s = input().split()
        max_char = chr(ord('a')-1)
        for c in s:
            if ord(c) > ord(max_char) and ord(c) > int(a):
                max_char = c
        print(ord(max_char)-ord('a'))
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define the function `find_ascii_difference` which takes an integer `n` as input.
2. We then use a for loop to iterate through `n` pairs of inputs.
3. For each pair, we split the input into integer `a` and string `s`.
4. We set the initial value of `max_char` to a character that has an ASCII value lower than the lower bound of all characters in the string `s`.
5. We then iterate through all the characters in `s` and update `max_char` to the character that has the largest ASCII value greater than `a`. If no character in `s` has an ASCII value greater than `a`, the value of `max_char` will remain the same.
6. We calculate the difference between the ASCII value of `max_char` and the ASCII value of lowercase letter "a", and print the result.


Here's another way to solve this problem using the method name `find_ascii_difference`:

**Program 2:**

```python
def find_ascii_difference(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(n):
        a, s = input().split()
        max_char = max([c for c in s if ord(c) > int(a)], default='a')
        print(ord(max_char)-ord('a'))
```

**Explanation:** 

1. We define the function `find_ascii_difference` which takes an integer `n` as input.
2. We then use a for loop to iterate through `n` pairs of inputs.
3. For each pair, we split the input into integer `a` and string `s`.
4. We create a list of all characters in `s` that have an ASCII value greater than `a`.
5. We then use the `max` function to find the character with the largest ASCII value in this list. If the list is empty, we set the default value to `'a'` so that the program won't throw an error.
6. We calculate the difference between the ASCII value of `max_char` and the ASCII value of lowercase letter "a", and print the result.
