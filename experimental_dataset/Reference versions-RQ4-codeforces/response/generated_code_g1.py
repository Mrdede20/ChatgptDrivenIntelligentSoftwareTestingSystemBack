Here are two implementations of the program:

**Implementation 1:**

```python
def find_same_xor_paths(adj_list: list, A: int, B: int) -> bool:
    # Convert adjacency list to undirected graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(len(adj_list))]
    for i, neighbors in enumerate(adj_list):
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            graph[i].append(neighbor)
            graph[neighbor].append(i)
    
    # Use DFS to find all paths from A to B and store their XOR sums
    paths = []
    def dfs(node, target, visited, xor_sum, current_path):
        if node == target:
            paths.append(xor_sum)
        else:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    dfs(neighbor, target, visited, xor_sum ^ 1, current_path + [neighbor])
            visited.remove(node)
    
    dfs(A, B, set(), 0, [])
    
    # Check if there exist two XOR sums that are the same
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(paths)):
            if paths[i] == paths[j]:
                return True
                
    return False
```

**Implementation 2:**

```python
def find_same_xor_paths(adj_list: list, A: int, B: int) -> bool:
    # Convert adjacency list to undirected graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(len(adj_list))]
    for i, neighbors in enumerate(adj_list):
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            graph[i].append(neighbor)
            graph[neighbor].append(i)
    
    # Use BFS to find all paths from A to B and store their XOR sums
    paths = []
    queue = [(A, 0, [])]
    while queue:
        node, xor_sum, current_path = queue.pop(0)
        if node == B:
            paths.append(xor_sum)
        else:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in current_path:
                    queue.append((neighbor, xor_sum ^ 1, current_path + [node]))
    
    # Check if there exist two XOR sums that are the same
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(paths)):
            if paths[i] == paths[j]:
                return True
                
    return False
```

Both functions take in an adjacency list `adj_list`, representing an undirected graph where each element `adj_list[i]` is a list of neighbors for node `i`. They also take in two integer parameters `A` and `B`, representing the starting and ending nodes for the paths to be searched.

The first step for both implementations is to convert the adjacency list to an undirected graph. This is done by iterating over each node in the adjacency list and adding each neighbor to the corresponding node in the undirected graph.

Next, both implementations use a graph traversal algorithm to find all paths from node A to node B. Implementation 1 uses depth-first search (DFS) while implementation 2 uses breadth-first search (BFS). During the traversal, each path's XOR sum is calculated and stored in a list.

Finally, both functions check whether there exist two XOR sums in the list that are the same. If yes, the function returns True indicating that there exist two different paths from node A to node B in the undirected graph that have the same XOR sum for all edges present in the path. If not, the function returns False indicating that no such paths exist.
