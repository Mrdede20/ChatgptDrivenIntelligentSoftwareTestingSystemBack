Here are two programs that achieve the same intention:

Program 1:

```python
def calculate_k(t:int, queries:List[Tuple[int,int,int,List[int]]]) -> List[int]:
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, c, d, A = queries[i]
        A.sort(reverse=True)
        if sum(A[:d]) >= c:
            results.append("Infinity")
        elif sum(A[:d]) * d < c:
            results.append("Impossible")
        else:
            left = 0
            right = n // (d+1) + 1
            while left < right:
                mid = (left+right) // 2
                selected_sum = 0
                j = 0
                k = mid * (d+1)
                while j < d and k > 0:
                    selected_sum += A[j]
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                while k > 0:
                    selected_sum += A[j]
                    j += 1
                    k -= mid
                if selected_sum >= c:
                    right = mid
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            results.append(left)
    return results
```

Program 2:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def calculate_k(t:int, queries:List[Tuple[int,int,int,List[int]]]) -> List[int]:
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, c, d, A = queries[i]
        A = [-a for a in A]
        heapq.heapify(A)
        if -sum(heapq.nsmallest(d, A)) >= c:
            results.append("Infinity")
        elif -sum(heapq.nsmallest(d, A)) * d < c:
            results.append("Impossible")
        else:
            left = 0
            right = n // (d+1) + 1
            while left < right:
                mid = (left+right) // 2
                heap = []
                selected_sum = 0
                for j in range(d):
                    selected_sum -= heapq.heappushpop(A, 0)
                heappush(heap, selected_sum)
                for j in range(mid-1):
                    selected_sum = 0
                    for k in range(d+1):
                        if len(A) > 0:
                            selected_sum -= heapq.heappop(A)
                    heappush(heap, selected_sum)
                if -sum(heapq.nsmallest(d-1, heap)) >= c:
                    right = mid
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            results.append(left)
    return results
```

Both of these programs take in an integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `c`, `d`, and a list of `n` integers `A`. The program then returns a list of `t` integers, representing the smallest value of `k` for each query.

The first program uses a binary search algorithm to find the smallest value of `k` that satisfies the conditions. It sorts `A` in descending order, then checks if the sum of the `d` largest elements is greater than or equal to `c`. If so, it outputs "Infinity". If not, it checks if the sum of the `d` largest elements multiplied by `d` is less than `c`. If so, it outputs "Impossible". Otherwise, it runs a binary search between `0` and `n // (d+1) + 1` to find the smallest value of `k` that satisfies the conditions.

The second program also uses a binary search algorithm, but it uses a heap to keep track of the largest elements. It first negates all the elements in `A` and heapifies them. It then checks if the sum of the `d` smallest elements is less than or equal to the negation of `c`. If so, it outputs "Infinity". If not, it checks if the sum of the `d` smallest elements multiplied by `d` is greater than the negation of `c`. If so, it outputs "Impossible". Otherwise, it runs a binary search between `0` and `n // (d+1) + 1` to find the smallest value of `k` that satisfies the conditions. It uses a heap to track the sum of the `d` largest elements in each group of `k+1` consecutive elements, and uses `nsmallest` to find the `d-1` smallest sums to check against `c`.
