Program 1:

```
def find_differences(t: int, test_cases: list):
    for i in range(t):
        n, s = test_cases[i]
        largest = max(s)
        s.remove(largest)
        second_largest = max(s)
        for item in s:
            print(abs(largest-item), abs(second_largest-item))
```

Program 2:

```
def find_differences(t: int, test_cases: list):
    for i in range(t):
        n, s = test_cases[i]
        largest = max(s)
        second_largest = max(c for c in s if c != largest)
        for item in s:
            print(abs(largest-item), abs(second_largest-item))
```

Both programs achieve the same goal, which is to find the two maximum values of a list and calculate the differences between all the other items and these two maximum values. To achieve this, we use a loop to iterate over each test case, and then we use the `max()` function to find the largest and second largest values in the list. We then iterate over the list again and calculate the differences between each item and the two maximum values using the `abs()` function. The only difference between the two programs is the way we find the second largest value, using either a list comprehension or by removing the largest value first.
