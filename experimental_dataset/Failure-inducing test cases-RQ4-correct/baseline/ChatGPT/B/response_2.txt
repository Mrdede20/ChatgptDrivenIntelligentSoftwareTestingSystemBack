Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program. 

If the input string 's' contains non-alphabetical characters, the program will throw a TypeError as ord() only works on ASCII characters. To trigger this bug, a test case with a non-alphabetical character in the input string 's' can be used. 

For example: 

Input 
3
5
abcd1
3
bbc
4
dCba

Output 
1
2
4

In the first test case, the input string 'abcd1' contains a non-alphabetical character '1', which will trigger a TypeError.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here's a test case that can trigger a bug in the program:

Input:
3
5
abCde
3
Dfg
4
hiJk

Output:
3
4
10

Explanation:
This test case includes uppercase letters in the input string. The program tries to calculate the ASCII value of the uppercase letters using ord() function, which will result in a bug as ord() returns different values for uppercase letters compared to lowercase letters. The expected output in this case should be 3, 4, and 8, but the actual output will be different.
