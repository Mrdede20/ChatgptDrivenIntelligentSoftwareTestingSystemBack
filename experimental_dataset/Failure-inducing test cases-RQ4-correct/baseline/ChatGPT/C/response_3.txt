Yes, there could be a test case that triggers a bug in the program. 

One possible test case is when the input list contains duplicate maximum values. For example, if the input s is [3, 7, 5, 7], the program may not correctly identify the two maximum values and could produce incorrect output. 

To fix this bug, the program could modify the logic of finding the maximum values by checking for equal values and storing multiple indices if necessary.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's an example test case that exposes the bug in the program:

Input:
1
4
3 7 5 7

Expected Output:
2 4 2 4 

Actual Output:
2 1 2 1 

As you can see, the program incorrectly identifies the first maximum value as the only maximum value, and produces incorrect output.
