Yes, a test case that could trigger a bug in the program above is:

Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5

Expected Output:
4 3 2 1 0 

Actual Output:
4 3 2 1 -1 

In this scenario, the program is not considering the case where there are two numbers with the same value as the maximum. In this situation, the program should choose the second maximum value to calculate the difference instead of selecting the minimum value.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I need more context to understand what kind of test case you are asking for. Could you please provide more details or specify the programming language and scenario you are referring to?
