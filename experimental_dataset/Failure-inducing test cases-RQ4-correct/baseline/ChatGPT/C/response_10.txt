response@ChatGPT:
Yes, there is a test case which can trigger a bug in the program.

If the input array "s" has only one element, the program will fail as it is expected to have at least two elements to calculate the difference between the maximum and second maximum elements.

For example, inputting the following values:

1
1
5

Will cause the program to try to access "s[mx[1]]", which will result in an "IndexError" as "mx[1]" is equal to -1.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here is the test case that triggers the bug in the program:
\
\Number of test cases t: 1
\Value of n: 1
\Elements of array s : 10
\
\With input values as given above, the program will fail to execute because the array s has only one element and it cannot find the second maximum element.
