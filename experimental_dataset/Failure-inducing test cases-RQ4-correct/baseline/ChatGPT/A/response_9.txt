Yes, there is a test case which can trigger a bug in the program above. 

If the input contains only one number in each line, such as:

```
2
5
10
```

The program will throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" error. This is because in the first iteration of the while loop, the sorted list only contains one element (since there is only one number in the input), and thus there is no second smallest number to print. 

To fix this issue, the program could check if the sorted list has at least two elements before trying to access the second smallest number.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
A test case that could trigger the bug in the program is:

```
2
5
```

With this input, the program will sort the list `[5]`, which will only have one element. Then, it will try to access the second smallest number with `a[1]`, causing the "IndexError: list index out of range" error to occur.
