Yes, if the input list contains only one element, the program will throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" error, as there is no second element to print. This can be tested with the following test case:

Input:
1
5

Output:
IndexError: list index out of range

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Thank you for the correction. Here is a potential test case that could trigger the bug:

Input:
3
5
7
3

Output:
5
7
3

Expected Output:
3
5
7

Explanation:
The program is intended to sort the input list and print the second element. However, in this test case, the program produces incorrect output, because the sorting order is not being taken into account. The correct output should sort and return the second element, which is 3, 5, and 7, respectively.
