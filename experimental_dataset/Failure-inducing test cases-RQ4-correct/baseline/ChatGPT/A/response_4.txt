Yes, there is a test case that can trigger a bug in the program above. 

If the input contains only one number in each iteration of the while loop, then the program will raise an IndexError because a[1] will try to access the second element of a, which does not exist in this case.

For example, if the input is:

3
5
4
6

The program will work correctly for the first two iterations, but it will raise an IndexError in the third iteration, as a only contains one element.

request@user:
Give us such test case.
