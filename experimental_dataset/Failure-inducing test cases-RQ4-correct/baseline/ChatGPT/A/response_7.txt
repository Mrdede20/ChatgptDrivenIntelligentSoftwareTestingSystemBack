Yes, a test case that can trigger a bug in this program is when one of the input arrays has only one element. In such a case, the program will fail with an "IndexError: list index out of range" error. This is because the program assumes that every input array will have at least two elements, which is not true for arrays with only one element.

Example:

Input:
2
3
1
5

Expected Output:
1
3

Actual Output:
IndexError: list index out of range

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, below is a test case that can trigger the bug in the program:

Input:
1
5

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output:
IndexError: list index out of range
