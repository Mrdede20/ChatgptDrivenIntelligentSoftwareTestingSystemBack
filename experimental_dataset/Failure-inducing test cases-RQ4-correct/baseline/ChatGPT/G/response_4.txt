Yes, there are multiple possible test cases that can trigger bugs in the program:

1. Test case where n=1: The program assumes that n is always greater than 1, so a test case with n=1 can cause issues.

2. Test case with negative edge weights: The program does not handle negative edge weights, so a test case with negative edge weights can cause unexpected behavior.

3. Test case with disconnected graph: The program assumes that the graph is connected, so a test case with a disconnected graph can cause issues.

4. Test case with duplicate edges between two nodes: The program assumes that there is at most one edge between any two nodes, so a test case with multiple edges between two nodes can cause issues.

5. Test case where a=b: The program assumes that a and b are different nodes, so a test case where a=b can cause issues.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here's an example test case with negative edge weights:

Input:
\
1
\
4 -1 4
\
1 2 -5
\
1 3 10
\
3 4 3

Expected Output:
\
YES

Explanation:
\
In this test case, there is a negative edge weight (-5) between nodes 1 and 2. However, the program does not handle negative edge weights properly and can produce unexpected results. This test case should trigger a bug in the program.
