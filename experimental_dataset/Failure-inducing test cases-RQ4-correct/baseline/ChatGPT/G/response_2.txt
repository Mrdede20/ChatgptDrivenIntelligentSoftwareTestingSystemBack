Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above. One such test case is when the input contains a disconnected graph, which means there are two or more parts of the graph that are not connected to each other. In this case, the program assumes that the graph is connected and tries to find a path between two given nodes, which could result in incorrect output. Another test case could be when the input contains negative weights for the edges, as the program assumes all edges are non-negative. This could also result in incorrect output.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here is an example test case that can trigger a bug in the program:

Test Input:
2
4 1 3
1 2 3
2 3 -1
6 1 6
1 2 3
2 3 -1
4 5 2
3 4 2
5 6 1

Expected Output:
YES
YES

Explanation:
In the first test case, the graph contains two disconnected parts: nodes 1 and 2, and node 4. However, the program assumes that the graph is connected and tries to find a path between nodes 1 and 3, which results in incorrect output.
Similarly, in the second test case, there are negative weights for some edges, which the program assumes are non-negative, resulting in incorrect output.
