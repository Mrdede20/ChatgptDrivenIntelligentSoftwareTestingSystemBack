Yes, there are many test cases that can potentially trigger bugs in the program. 

One possible test case is when the input values are such that there is a disconnected graph with multiple connected components. The program assumes that the graph is connected and will not work correctly in such cases.

Another possible test case is when the input values result in a graph with cycles. The program does not check for cycles and may produce incorrect results if cycles exist in the graph.

Another possible test case is when the input values are such that the graph has a vertex with no edges. The program assumes that all vertices have at least one edge and may produce incorrect results if there are isolated vertices.

Finally, the program may also have bugs related to array indexing, especially if the input values are very large. It is important to test the program with a variety of input values to identify and fix any such bugs.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here's an example of a test case that could trigger a bug in the program:
\
\Input:
3
3 1 2
1 2 3
2 3 4
4 1 2
1 2 5
2 3 6
3 4 7
4 5 8
4 4 5
1 2 1
1 4 2
2 4 3
2 3 4
\
\Output:
YES
YES
NO
\
\Explanation:
In the first case, the graph is disconnected with vertices 1 and 3 in one component, and vertex 2 in the other. The program assumes that the graph is connected and will produce an incorrect result.
\
\In the second case, the graph has cycles (2-3-4-5-2), but the program does not check for cycles and may produce an incorrect result.
\
\In the third case, vertex 3 has no edges, but the program assumes that all vertices have at least one edge and may produce an incorrect result.
