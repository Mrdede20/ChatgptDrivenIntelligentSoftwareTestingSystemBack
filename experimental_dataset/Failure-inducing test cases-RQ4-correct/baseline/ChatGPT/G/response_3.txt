Yes, there are multiple possible test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above. Here are some examples:

1. Test case with two nodes and one edge:

Input:
1
2 1 2
1 2 3

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

Explanation: The program assumes that there are at least three nodes, but this test case has only two nodes.

2. Test case where there is no path from A to B:

Input:
1
4 1 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there is no path from A to B correctly. In this test case, there is no path from node 1 to node 4, but the program still outputs "YES" instead of "NO".

3. Test case where there are multiple paths from A to B:

Input:
1
4 1 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO

Explanation: The program only checks if there is at least one common node in the paths from A to B and from B to A, but it does not handle the case where there are multiple paths from A to B. In this test case, there are two paths from node 1 to node 4 (1->2->3->4 and 1->2->4), so the expected output is "YES" instead of "NO".

Give us such test case.

Here's another test case that can trigger a bug in the program:

\Input:
\1
\5 1 5
\1 2 1
\2 3 2
\2 4 3
\4 5 4
\
\Expected Output:
\YES
\
\Actual Output:
\NO
\
\Explanation: The program incorrectly outputs "NO" instead of "YES" for this test case. The correct output should be "YES" because there are two paths from node 1 to node 5 (1->2->4->5 and 1->2->3->5) that have more than one common node with the path from node 5 to node 1 (5->4->2->1).
