One possible test case that may trigger a bug is:

Input:
1
4 1 2
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 4 3

Expected Output:
YES

Explanation: 
There are two possible paths from node 1 to node 2: 1-2 and 1-4-2. Both paths have an XOR sum of 1 (1 XOR 0 and 3 XOR 2), which means there is a cycle with an odd number of edges. Therefore, the output should be YES. However, the program may incorrectly output NO if it does not handle this case properly.

request@user:
Give us such test case.

I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I'm unable to provide a context for a test case without information on the program or system under test. Could you please provide me with more details?
