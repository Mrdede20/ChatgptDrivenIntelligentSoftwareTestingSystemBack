Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. However, without knowing the specific requirements or expected behavior of the program, it is difficult to identify a single test case that could universally expose a bug in the code. More thorough testing would need to be done in order to identify any potential bugs or errors in the program.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Unfortunately, since the specific requirements and expected behavior of the program are not provided, it is difficult to provide a specific test case that will cause a bug. The test case will depend on the expected behavior and functionality of the program. If you can provide more information about the program, I can suggest a suitable test case.
