Yes, there are multiple possible test cases that can trigger a bug in the program above. One potential test case is when the input consists of a single node and no edges, which would result in an index out of range error when trying to access the edges list. Another potential test case is when the input consists of two nodes connected by an edge with weight 0, which would result in an incorrect output of "NO" when the correct output is "YES". Additionally, large inputs with many nodes and edges could potentially cause the program to run out of memory or exceed the time limit.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
For the second potential test case I mentioned, you could input the following:
\
1
2 1 2
1 2 0
\
\This input consists of two nodes (1 and 2) connected by an edge with weight 0, and the program should output "YES" but may output "NO" due to the bug.
