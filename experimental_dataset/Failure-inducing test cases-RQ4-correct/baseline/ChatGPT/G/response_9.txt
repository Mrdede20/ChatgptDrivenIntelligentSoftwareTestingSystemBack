response@ChatGPT:
One test case that could trigger a bug in the program is when the input is:

3
4 1 4
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 4 5
4 1 3
1 2 3
2 3 4
4 3 2
1 2 3
2 3 4

This input creates a graph with two possible paths from node 1 to node 3: 1-2-3 and 1-4-3. The program should output "YES" because there are two distinct paths with different XOR values from node A to node B. However, due to an error in the program logic, it may output "NO".

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
I have already provided a test case in my previous response. Do you want me to provide another test case?
