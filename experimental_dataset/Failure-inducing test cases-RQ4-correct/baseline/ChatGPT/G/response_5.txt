Yes, there can be multiple test cases which can trigger a bug in the program depending on the input values, but without knowing the expected output or the specific bug, it is difficult to suggest a particular test case. However, some possible scenarios which may trigger bugs are:

- If the input values do not match the program's assumptions or constraints, such as negative values or invalid characters in the input, it may cause errors or unexpected behavior.
- If the input graph has certain properties, such as loops or disconnected components, the program may give incorrect results or crash.
- If the values of variables or arrays are not initialized or updated correctly during the execution of the program, it may cause errors or incorrect outputs.
- If the program uses inefficient or incorrect logic to traverse the graph or compute the XOR values, it may lead to incorrect results or slow performance.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here's an example test case that may trigger a bug in the program:
\
\Input:
\
3
3 1 3
1 2 2
2 3 3
3 2 3
1 2 3
1 3 2
\
\Output:
\
YES
\
NO
\
Explanation: 
\
In the first query, the path from node 1 to node 3 passes through both node 2 and node 3, so it should output "YES". However, the program may give incorrect results if it fails to compute the correct fromA and fromB arrays or to check for common nodes using set operations or count the number of zero XOR values correctly. 
\
In the second query, the path from node 1 to node 3 does not pass through any common nodes, so it should output "NO". However, the program may give incorrect results if it fails to account for the absence of common nodes or to handle the boundary cases correctly.
