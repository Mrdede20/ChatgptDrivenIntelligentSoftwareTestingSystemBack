One potential test case that could trigger a bug is the input:

5
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
5 4 3 2 1
5
1 5 3 2 4
5
1 2 3 5 4
5
1 3 2 5 4

This test case checks various edge cases, such as strictly increasing or decreasing numbers, valleys at the beginning or the end of the list, and valleys with multiple contenders.

request@user:
Give us such test case.

Please specify what type of program or system you are referring to. Providing more context will help me provide a relevant test case.
