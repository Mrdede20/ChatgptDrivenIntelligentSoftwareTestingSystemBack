One test case that could trigger a bug is:

Input:
5
6 2 2 2 6
7 6 8 1 1
6 1 6 6 1
8 1 1 8 1 1 8
1 2 3 2 1

Output:
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO

This test case includes different scenarios, such as a simple uphill and downhill, a more complex uphill and downhill, a sequence with a valley at the beginning and end, and a symmetric sequence that reaches the same peak twice. This can help ensure the algorithm handles all cases correctly.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
For which program or system would you like me to provide a test case? Please provide more context so I can give you a relevant test case.
