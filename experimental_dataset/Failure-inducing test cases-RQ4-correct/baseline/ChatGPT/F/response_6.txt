Yes, there are multiple test cases that can trigger a bug in the program. One such test case would be:

Input:
2
4 10 2
8 4 3 2
3 5 1
1 2 3

Expected Output:
2
Impossible

Actual Output:
2
Infinity

This is because in the second test case, the program incorrectly identifies the sum of the top 'd' elements as greater than the required amount, leading to the wrong output of "Infinity". The correct output should be "Impossible", since the largest element in the list multiplied by 'd' is less than the required amount.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Sure, here is a test case that can potentially trigger a bug in the program:

\ Input:
\ 1
\ 3 7 2
\ 2 2 3

\ Expected Output:
\ 2

\ Actual Output:
\ Infinity

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the sum of the top 'd' elements, which should be 5 (2 + 3), but instead it considers only the first two elements with a sum of 4. As a result, it outputs "Infinity" which is incorrect. The correct output for this input should be 2, as the minimum number of selections required to get a sum of 7 is 2.
