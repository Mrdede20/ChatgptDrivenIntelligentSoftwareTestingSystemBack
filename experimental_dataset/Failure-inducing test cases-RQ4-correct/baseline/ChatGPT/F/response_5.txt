Yes, there are several test cases that can trigger a bug in the program.

Case 1:
Input:
1
3 7 3
1 2 1

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
- This test case will pass

Case 2:
Input:
1
3 7 3
1 3 1

Expected Output:
Infinity

Actual Output:
- This test case will pass

Case 3:
Input:
1
3 7 3
1 4 1

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
- This test case will fail
- The actual output is "Infinity"
- The issue is with the condition "if sum(A[:d])>=c". It should be "if sum(A[:d])>=c*d" since we need to select "d" elements and each element costs "sum(A[:d])/d" on average.

request@user:
Give us such test case. 

response@ChatGPT:
Can you provide a more specific program or scenario for me to create a test case?
