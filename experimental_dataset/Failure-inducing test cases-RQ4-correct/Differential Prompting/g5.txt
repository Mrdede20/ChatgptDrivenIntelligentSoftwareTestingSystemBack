Yes, there may be inputs that make the two programs output differently. Here's a potential test case:

```
t=1
n=4
a=0
b=3
edges=[
  {1: 1},
  {0: 1, 2: 1},
  {1: 1, 3: 1},
  {2: 1}
]
```

In this testcase, the first program would output "YES" and the second program would output "NO". You can use this input to test the programs.
