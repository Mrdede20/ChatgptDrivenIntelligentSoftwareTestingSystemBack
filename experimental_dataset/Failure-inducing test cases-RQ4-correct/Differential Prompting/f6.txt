Yes, there can be an input that makes the two programs have different outputs. 

Test Input Reasoning:

We can test for the case where the total coins needed to select are greater than the sum of all the elements in the array.

This is interesting because in the first program, the program will proceed to select the entire array until d elements have been selected. While in the second program, the code will return "Impossible"

Test Input:

5
5 20 2
9 7 -6 3 8 
4 15 2
4 7 2 -6
6 12 2
12 10 -8 7 9 2
4 10 3
7 6 5 4
3 30 3
10 20 15

Expected Output:

Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Test Output Reasoning:

In all the test cases, the total sum of the coins we can select is less than what is required to select d coins from the array.

For instance, in the first test case, we only have 9 coins to select and we need 20. It is not possible to pick any d elements that will give us the required coins. Thus the output is impossible for both programs. The other test cases follow a similar pattern.
