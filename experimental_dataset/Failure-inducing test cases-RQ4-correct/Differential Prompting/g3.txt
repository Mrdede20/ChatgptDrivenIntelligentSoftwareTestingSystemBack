Yes, there can be inputs that make the two programs produce different outputs.

Test input:
```
1
4 1 3
1 2 1
1 3 2
2 4 3
```

Output of the first program:
```
NO
```

Output of the second program:
```
True
```

Explanation: The first program checks whether there are at least two distinct paths from A to B with different XOR values. In this case, there is only one path from 1 to 3 with XOR value 2. Therefore, the answer is "NO".

The second program checks whether there are two paths with the same XOR value. In this case, there are two paths: 1-2-4 with XOR value 2, and 1-3-2-4 with XOR value 2 as well. Therefore, the answer is True.
