Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. 

Test Input:
2
5 java
4 code

Expected Output:
10
8

Explanation: 
For the first input, the maximum unicode value in the first program is ord('v') = 118, which gives an output of 118-96 = 22. The maximum unicode value in the second program is ord('a') = 97, which gives an output of 97-96 = 1.

For the second input, the maximum unicode value in the first program is ord('e') = 101, which gives an output of 101-96 = 5. The maximum unicode value in the second program is ord('o') = 111, which gives an output of 111-96 = 15.
