Yes, there are input values that can make the two programs have different output. Here's an example test case:

Input:
```
1
4 1 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
```

Expected output for the first program:
```
NO
```

Expected output for the second program:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
In this input graph, there is only one path from node 1 to node 3: `[1, 2, 3]`. The XOR sum of the edges on this path is `1 ^ 1 = 0`. However, there is another path from node 1 to node 3: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The XOR sum of the edges on this path is also `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1`. Therefore, there exist two XOR sums that are the same, and the second program should return "YES". The first program considers only paths of length 2, so it will return "NO".
