Yes, there is an input which makes the two programs have different output, and here is the Java code to generate the input:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestInputGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = 2;
        System.out.println(t);
        while (t-- > 0) {
            System.out.println("100000 999999 999998");
            System.out.println("900000000 1 1000000000");
            System.out.println("99999 100000 100001");
        }
    }
}
```

The input generated by this program will have `t = 2`. For each value of `t`, the program will print three lines, each containing three integers. The input is designed to make the two programs output different results.
