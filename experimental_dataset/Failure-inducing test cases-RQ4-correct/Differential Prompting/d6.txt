Yes, there can be an input which makes the two programs have different output.

Test Input Reasoning:

Let's consider the simplest input where we have only one mountain of height 1.

Test Input

1
1
1

Test Output Reasoning:

For the first program, the output will be YES, meaning only one mountain exists.
For the second program, the output will be NO, since there is no peak.

Thus the output of the two programs will be different. 

Test Output

NO

YES

Test Input Reasoning:

Let's consider an input where we have only two mountains, of height 1 which are at different heights.

Test Input

1
2
1 2

Test Output Reasoning:

For both programs, the output will be YES since there is only one peak and it satisfies the condition.

Thus the output of the two programs will be the same.

Test Output

YES
YES

Test Input Reasoning:

Let's consider an input where we have only two mountains, of height 1 which are at same heights.

Test Input

1
2
1 1

Test Output Reasoning:

For the first program, the output will be YES, since only one mountain exists.
For the second program, the output will be NO, since there is no peak.

Thus the output of the two programs will be different.

Test Output

NO
YES

Test Input Reasoning:

Let's consider an input where we have three mountains, of height 1 which are at different heights.

Test Input

1
3
1 2 1

Test Output Reasoning:

For both programs, the output will be YES since there is only one peak and it satisfies the condition.

Thus the output of the two programs will be the same.

Test Output

YES
YES

Test Input Reasoning:

Let's consider an input where we have three mountains, of height 1 which are at the same heights.

Test Input

1
3
1 1 1

Test Output Reasoning:

For the first program, the output will be YES, since only one mountain exists.
For the second program, the output will be NO.

Thus the output of the two programs will be different.

Test Output

NO
YES
