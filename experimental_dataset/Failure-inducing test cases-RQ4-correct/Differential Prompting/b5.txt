Yes, there is an input that would make the two programs output different results. An example input is:

```
3
5 abc
7 defg
8 hijklmno
```

The first program will output:

```
2
5
14
```

while the second program will output:

```
2
5
15
```

To generate this test input in Java, you can use the following code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestInputGenerator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = 3;
        System.out.println(n);

        System.out.println("5 abc");
        System.out.println("7 defg");
        System.out.println("8 hijklmno");

        scanner.close();
    }
}

```

This will print the test input to the console, which you can copy and paste into the console of the program you want to test.
