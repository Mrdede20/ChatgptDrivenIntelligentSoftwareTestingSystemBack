Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here's a sample test input:

```
5
5
1 2 3 2 1
5
5 4 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
5 4 3 2 1
5
1 3 5 4 2
```

The expected outputs of the two programs would be:

```
solve():
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES

find_peak():
NO
NO
YES
NO
YES
```

Both programs are checking if a mountain range contains a single peak with higher elevation than any other points in the mountain besides its two adjacent points. The test input is designed so that both functions return `NO` on the first three test cases and `YES` on the last two test cases. However, the test case with mountain range `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` has a peak in the middle, but the mountain range is not strictly increasing or decreasing on the left and right sides of the peak. Therefore, `solve()` returns `NO`, but `find_peak()` returns `YES`.
