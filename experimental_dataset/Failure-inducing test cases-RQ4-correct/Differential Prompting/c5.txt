Yes, there are inputs that can make the two programs have different output. Here's an example:

Input:
2
5
5 4 6 3 7
4
1 5 5 1

Output from first program:
2 1 -1 3 -1 
4 0 0 4 

Output from second program:
2
1
-1
3
-1
4
0
0
4

To generate more test cases, you can use the following code:

import random

# Generate random test cases
for i in range(5):
    n = random.randint(2, 10)
    s = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]
    print(n)
    print(" ".join(map(str, s)))

# Test case where all elements are the same
print(5)
print("1 1 1 1 1")

# Test case where elements are in descending order
print(5)
print("5 4 3 2 1")
