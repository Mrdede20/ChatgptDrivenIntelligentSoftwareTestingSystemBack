Yes, there is an input that can make the two programs have different output. Here is a test input:

```
1
5 1 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
2 4 0
4 5 1
```

The first program will output `YES` while the second program will output `False`.

To generate this input, you can use the following code:

```java
int t = 1;
int n = 5, a = 1, b = 4;
int[][] inputEdges = {{1, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 1}, {2, 4, 0}, {4, 5, 1}};

System.out.println(t);
System.out.println(n + " " + (a+1) + " " + (b+1));
for (int[] edge : inputEdges) {
    System.out.println(edge[0] + " " + edge[1] + " " + edge[2]);
}
```

Note: I increased the values of `a` and `b` by 1, because the first program subtracts 1 from them, but the second program doesn't.
