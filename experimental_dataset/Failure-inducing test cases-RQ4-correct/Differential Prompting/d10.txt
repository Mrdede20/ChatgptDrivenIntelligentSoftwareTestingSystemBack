Yes, there is input that can make the two programs have different outputs. Here's an example test case:

Input:
```
5
5
1 2 3 2 1
5
1 2 3 4 3
5
3 2 1 2 3
4
1 2 1 2
4
1 2 2 1
```

Output for the first program:
```
NO
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

Output for the second program:
```
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

Explanation:
- The first and the third test case are mountain ranges with a peak, but they don't satisfy the condition of trivial win, where the mountain to the left and right of the peak should be lower than the peak.
- The fourth and fifth test case don't have a peak.
- The second test case is a mountain range with a peak and satisfies the trivial win condition.
