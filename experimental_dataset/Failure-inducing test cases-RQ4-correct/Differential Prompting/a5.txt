Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output.

Here's a possible input that would cause the two programs to have different output:

Input:
```
2
1 1 100
50 40 30
100 200 300
```

Output of first program:
```
1
40
200
300
```

Output of second program:
```
1
40
100
```

To generate this input in Java, you can use the following code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestInputGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int t = 2;
        System.out.println(t);

        System.out.println("1 1 100");
        System.out.println("50 40 30");

        System.out.println("100 200 300");
    }
}
``` 

This will output the required input to the console. You can then copy and paste this output to test your programs.
