Yes, there is an input that makes the two programs have different output. Here is one example: 

Input:

1
4 1 4
1 2 0
2 3 1
3 4 1

Expected output:

YES

Explanation: There are two paths from node 1 to node 4, one with XOR sum of 0 and one with XOR sum of 1. Similarly, there are two paths from node 4 to node 1, one with XOR sum of 0 and one with XOR sum of 1. Therefore, there exist two XOR sums that are the same, making the output YES.

However, the second program will output NO for this input because it is only checking if there exist two nodes with the same XOR sum, but not specifically for paths between A and B.
