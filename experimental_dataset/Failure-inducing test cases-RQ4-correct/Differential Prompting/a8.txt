Yes, there is an input which can make the two programs to have different output. 

Test Input:

3
2 7 4
5 1 8
6 3 9

Expected Output for the first program:

6
2
7
5
2
6

Expected output for the second program:

4
5
6

Explanation:

The first program will output the second smallest number in each set of 3 numbers, while the second program removes the largest number from each set and then outputs the smallest number in the modified set.

For the input above, the first program will output 6, 2, and 7. The second program will remove 7, 8, and 9 from the sets and output 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the two programs will output different results for this input.
