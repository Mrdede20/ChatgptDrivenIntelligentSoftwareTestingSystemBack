Yes, there may be inputs that make the two programs output different results.

Here's a test input:

```
2
4 10 2
1 2 3 4
5 20 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

For this input:

- The first program outputs `2` and `1`.
- The second program outputs `1` and `0`.

Therefore, the two programs have different outputs for this input.
