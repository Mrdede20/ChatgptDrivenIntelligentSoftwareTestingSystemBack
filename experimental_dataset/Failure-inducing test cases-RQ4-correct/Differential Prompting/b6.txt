Yes, there is an input that could make the two programs have different output. Specifically, if the value of `a` in the first program is initialized to `None` instead of `0`, and a non-numeric value is entered as the first input, the first program will throw a `TypeError`, whereas the second program will run without error but will output `0`.

Here is some test input to demonstrate this:

```
2
non_numeric_value string1
99 string2
```
The first line of input specifies that there are two test cases. 

In the first test case, the first input value (`a`) is a string, not a number. This will cause the first program to throw a `TypeError`, whereas the second program will run without error and output `0`. 

In the second test case, the first input value (`a`) is a number, and the string contains characters with unicode values greater than `a`. Both programs will output the correct maximum unicode value minus 96 (since the input characters are all lowercase letters). 

So the expected output for this input is:
```
0
25
```
