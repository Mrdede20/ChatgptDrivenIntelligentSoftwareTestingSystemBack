Yes, there can be different outputs for the two programs. 

To generate a test input, you can use the following:

```
2
5
1 0 0 0 1
6
0 0 1 1 1 0
```

For this input, the first program will output:

```
5
5
```

And the second program will output:

```
3
4
``` 

Therefore, this input can be used as a test case to check if the two programs are providing different outputs.
