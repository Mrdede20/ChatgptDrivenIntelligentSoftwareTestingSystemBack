Yes, there are input cases that could make the two programs have different output. Here's a test input that could generate different output:

```
3
6
1 2 3 2 1 2
9
1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1
7
1 2 3 4 3 2 1
```

The output of the first program would be:

```
YES
NO
NO
```

While the output of the second program would be:

```
YES
NO
YES
```
