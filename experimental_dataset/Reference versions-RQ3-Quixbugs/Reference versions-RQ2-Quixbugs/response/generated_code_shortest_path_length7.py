Both of these programs implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph, using the same method name `shortest_path_length` and the same parameter type `(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode)`. 

The difference between the two programs is that Program 1 uses the `get` and `insert_or_update` helper functions to modify the priority queue `unvisited_nodes`, while Program 2 uses a dictionary `distances` to keep track of the shortest distances from the start node to each visited node. In Program 2, the `distances` dictionary is updated when a shorter path is found to a visited node, and the `(successor_node, distance)` pair is only added to the priority queue if the distance is shorter than the current shortest distance in the `distances` dictionary. This avoids the need for the `get` and `insert_or_update` helper functions, but adds some extra code for maintaining the `distances` dictionary.
