Sure, here are two Python programs that implement the `sqrt` function using the Newton-Raphson method:

Program 1:
```python
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x/2
    while abs(x - approx**2) > epsilon:
        approx = (approx + x/approx)/2
    return approx
```
Program 2:
```python
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x/2
    difference = abs(x - approx**2)
    while difference > epsilon:
        approx = (approx + x/approx)/2
        difference = abs(x - approx**2)
    return approx
```
Both programs use the same method name and parameter types. They start by setting the initial approximation to `x/2`, and then repeatedly update the approximation until the difference between `x` and `approx` squared falls below `epsilon`. Both programs return the computed approximation.

The second program additionally initializes a variable `difference` to track the difference between `x` and `approx` squared, and checks that variable in the while loop condition. This way, the program can exit the loop as soon as the difference between the approximation and the actual value falls below `epsilon`.

These programs assume that the inputs satisfy the preconditions mentioned in the prompt.
