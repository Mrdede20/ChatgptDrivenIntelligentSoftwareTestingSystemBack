Here are the two programs that achieve the intention -

Program 1:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    tortoise = node
    hare = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False

        hare = hare.successor.successor
        tortoise = tortoise.successor

        if hare == tortoise:
            return True
```

Program 2:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    tortoise = node
    hare = node

    while hare is not None and hare.successor is not None:
        hare = hare.successor.successor
        tortoise = tortoise.successor

        if hare == tortoise:
            return True

    return False
```

Both of these programs accomplish the same thing while using the tortoise-and-hare method to detect a cycle in the linked list. Program 1 uses `True` and `False` as return values an while loop, and Program 2 uses a `return False` statement after the while loop to indicate there is no cycle.
