Program 1:

```python
def newton_raphson_sqrt(x, epsilon):
    """
    Returns the approximated square root of 'x' with an error tolerance of 'epsilon' using Newton-Raphson method.
    
    Preconditions:
    - x >= 1
    - epsilon > 0
    """
    approx_sqrt = x/2
    while abs(approx_sqrt**2 - x) > epsilon:
        approx_sqrt = (approx_sqrt + x/approx_sqrt)/2
    return approx_sqrt
```

Program 2:

```python
def newton_raphson_sqrt(x, epsilon):
    """
    Returns the approximated square root of 'x' with an error tolerance of 'epsilon' using Newton-Raphson method.
    
    Preconditions:
    - x >= 1
    - epsilon > 0
    """
    approx_sqrt = x/2
    diff = abs(approx_sqrt**2 - x)
    while diff > epsilon:
        approx_sqrt = (approx_sqrt + x/approx_sqrt)/2
        diff = abs(approx_sqrt**2 - x)
    return approx_sqrt
```

Both programs achieve the same intention and have the same method name and parameter type. The only difference is the way the absolute difference between the approximated square root and the actual square root is computed and stored in a variable (`diff` in Program 2) before the while loop. This is a matter of preference and readability, as both ways are correct and equivalent.
