Here are two versions of the `next_permutation` function:

Version 1 - using nested loop:

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i+1]:
        i -= 1
    if i < 0:
        return None
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
    perm[i+1:] = reversed(perm[i+1:])
    return perm
```

Version 2 - using itertools library:

```python
import itertools

def next_permutation(perm):
    perms = itertools.permutations(perm)
    next_perm = None
    for p in perms:
        if p == perm:
            next_perm = next(perms, None)
            break
    return next_perm
```

Both versions take a list called `perm` containing a sequence of unique integers as input, and compute and return the lexicographically next permutation of the elements of the `perm` list as output. The first version uses a nested loop to find the next permutation, while the second version uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all permutations of the input list and find the next permutation.
