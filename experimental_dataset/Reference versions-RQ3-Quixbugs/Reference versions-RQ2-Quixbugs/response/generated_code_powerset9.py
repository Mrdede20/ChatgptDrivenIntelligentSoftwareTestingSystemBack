Here are two implementations that achieve the same goal:

1. Using Recursion:

```python
def get_all_subsets(lst):
    """
    Takes a list and returns a list of all possible subsets, including the empty set.
    
    Args:
    lst: list - The original list of items
    
    Returns:
    res: list - A list of lists containing all possible subsets of the input list
    
    Example Usage:
    >>> get_all_subsets([1,2,3])
    [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    """
    if not lst:
        return [[]]
    x = get_all_subsets(lst[1:])
    return x + [[lst[0]] + y for y in x]

```

2. Using Iteration:

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def get_all_subsets(lst):
    """
    Takes a list and returns a list of all possible subsets, including the empty set.

    Args:
    lst: list - The original list of items
    
    Returns:
    res: list - A list of lists containing all possible subsets of the input list
    
    Example Usage:
    >>> get_all_subsets([1,2,3])
    [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    """
    return list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(lst, r) for r in range(len(lst)+1)))
```


Both functions take a list as input and return a list of lists containing all possible subsets of the input list, including the empty set. They differ in their implementation. The first one uses recursion and concatenation using list comprehension to create the subsets. The second one uses the itertools library to generate all possible combinations of the input list, and returns them as a list of tuples, which are then converted to lists.
