Here are two programs that achieve the same intention using dynamic programming:
Program 1:

```python
from collections import Counter

def longest_common_substring(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    n, m = len(s), len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])
    return max_len

```

Program 2:

```python
from collections import Counter

def longest_common_substring(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    n, m = len(s), len(t)
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])
    return max_len
```

Both programs use the same method name - "longest_common_substring" - and the same parameter type - two strings "s" and "t". They achieve the intention of finding and returning the length of the longest substring that is common in the input strings by using dynamic programming approach.
