Here is the first implementation of the function using the described algorithm:

```python
def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n != 0:
        n ^= (n-1)
        count += 1
    return count
```

Here is a second implementation of the function using the built-in `bin` function to convert the input number to a binary string and then count the number of "1" characters in the string:

```python
def bitcount(n):
    return bin(n).count("1")
```

Both functions have the same method name (`bitcount`) and parameter type (`n`), but they use different algorithms to achieve the intended functionality. Try both implementations with various input values including negative and zero numbers.
