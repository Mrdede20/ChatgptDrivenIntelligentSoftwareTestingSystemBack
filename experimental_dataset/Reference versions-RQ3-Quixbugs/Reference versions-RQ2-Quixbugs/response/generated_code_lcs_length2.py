Here are two possible ways to implement the program:

## Program 1

```
from collections import Counter

def longest_common_substring(s, t):
    dp = Counter()
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[(i,j)] = dp[(i-1,j-1)] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[(i,j)])
    return max_len if dp else 0
```

## Program 2

```
from collections import Counter

def longest_common_substring(s, t):
    dp = Counter()
    max_len = 0
    for i, s_char in enumerate(s):
        for j, t_char in enumerate(t):
            if s_char == t_char:
                dp[(i,j)] = dp[(i-1,j-1)] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[(i,j)])
    return max_len if dp else 0
```

Both programs achieve the same goal using the same method name and parameter type. The only difference is in the way the loops are constructed and how the characters are accessed, which can be a matter of personal preference.
