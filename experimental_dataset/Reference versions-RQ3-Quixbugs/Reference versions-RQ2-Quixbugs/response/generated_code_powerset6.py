Sure, here are two programs that achieve the same intention using the same method name and parameter types:

Program 1:

```
def powerset(arr):
    if not arr:
        return [[]]
    else:
        result = []
        for subset in powerset(arr[1:]):
            result.append(subset)
            result.append([arr[0]] + subset)
        return result
```

Program 2:

```
def powerset(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    subsets = []
    for i in range(2**n):
        subset = []
        for j in range(n):
            if i & (1 << j):
                subset.append(arr[j])
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets
```

Both programs use a different approach to generate subsets of a given list, but they both achieve the same result. Program 1 uses recursion to generate subsets by taking the first element of the list and generating subsets of the remaining elements, while program 2 uses bit manipulation to generate subsets by iterating over a range of 2^N and checking which bits are set to 1 in each binary representation to form a subset.
