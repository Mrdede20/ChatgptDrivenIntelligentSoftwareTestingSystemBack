Program 1:

```
from collections import deque

def bfs(startnode, goalnode):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([startnode])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node == goalnode:
            return True
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in node.successors:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return False
```

Program 2:

```
from collections import deque

def bfs(startnode, goalnode):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([startnode])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node == goalnode:
            return True
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in node.successors():
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return False
```

Both programs implement the Breadth-First Search algorithm to check if a goalnode can be reached from a startnode in a directed graph. They use a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored, and explore all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. The only difference between the two programs is that Program 1 uses the class attribute `successors` directly to access the successors of a node, while Program 2 uses the class method `successors()` to access the successors of a node.
