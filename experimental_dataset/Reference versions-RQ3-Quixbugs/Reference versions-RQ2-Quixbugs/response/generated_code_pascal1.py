Program 1:

```python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for i in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for j in range(1, i):
            row.append(rows[i-1][j-1] + rows[i-1][j])
        row.append(1)
        rows.append(row)
    return rows
```

Program 2:

```python
def pascal(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [[1]]
    rows = [[1], [1, 1]]
    if n == 2:
        return rows
    for i in range(2, n):
        prev_row = rows[-1]
        new_row = [1]
        for j in range(1, i):
            new_row.append(prev_row[j-1] + prev_row[j])
        new_row.append(1)
        rows.append(new_row)
    return rows
```

Both programs achieve the same intention of creating a function named `pascal` which takes an integer 'n' as an input and returns the first 'n' rows of Pascal's triangle as a list of n lists. They use the same method name and the same parameter type. 

The first program uses two inner loops to iterate over all the positions in a row and adjust the values for each position in the new row. It then appends the newly created row to the list named 'rows' at the end of each iteration. 

The second program also uses two inner loops to create a new row, but it first checks if the value of 'n' is 0, 1, or 2 to avoid unnecessary calculations. It then appends the newly created row to the list named 'rows' at the end of each iteration.
