Here are two Python programs that achieve the intention of the code:

Program 1:

```python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        i = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if i == -1:
            i = cols
        lines.append(text[:i].rstrip())
        text = text[i:].lstrip()
    lines.append(text)
    return lines
```

Program 2:

```python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while text:
        i = cols
        if len(text) <= cols:
            lines.append(text.lstrip())
            break
        while text[i] != ' ':
            i -= 1
        lines.append(text[:i].lstrip())
        text = text[i:].lstrip()
    return lines
```

Both programs take in two arguments - `text` and `cols` - and return a list of lines where each line is no longer than the column width. They use a loop to split the text string into multiple lines of length not more than `cols`, and the `rfind()` method is applied to find the last space in the `cols + 1` characters of the text string from the start. A line is then created and appended to the list of lines, and the remaining text is updated to remove the line that has already been created. The loop continues until all of the text has been split into lines meeting the column width requirement.
