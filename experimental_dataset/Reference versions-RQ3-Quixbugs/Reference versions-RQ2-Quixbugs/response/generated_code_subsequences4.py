Program 1:

```
def generate_subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if k == 1:
        return [[i] for i in range(a, b+1)]
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b+1):
        subsequences = generate_subsequences(i+1, b, k-1)
        for subsequence in subsequences:
            ret.append([i]+subsequence)
    return ret
```

Program 2:

```
def generate_subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if k == 1:
        return [[i] for i in range(a, b+1)]
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b+1-k+1):
        subsequences = generate_subsequences(i+1, b, k-1)
        for subsequence in subsequences:
            ret.append([i]+subsequence)
    return ret
```

Both programs achieve the same goal of generating all possible sub-sequences of length k, consisting of integers in the range [a, b] in ascending order. They both use recursion to generate these sub-sequences and follow the same logic as outlined in the problem description.

The only difference between the two programs is in the range of i in the for loop. Program 1 uses the range `[a, b]`, while Program 2 uses the range `[a, b+1-k]`. Both ranges achieve the same goal, but Program 2 uses some algebraic manipulation to simplify the range and avoid any unnecessary looping.
