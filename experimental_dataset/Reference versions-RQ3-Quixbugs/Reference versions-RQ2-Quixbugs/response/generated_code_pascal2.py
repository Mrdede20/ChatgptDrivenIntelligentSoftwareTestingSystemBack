Here are the two programs based on the given requirements:

Program 1:

```
def pascal(n):
    """
    This function generates the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
    The resulting triangle is represented as a list of n lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.
    """
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = [1] * (i+1)
        for j in range(1, i):
            row[j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j]
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle
```

Program 2:

```
def pascal(n):
    """
    This function generates the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
    The resulting triangle is represented as a list of n lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.
    """
    triangle = [[1]]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prev_row = triangle[-1]
        next_row = [1]
        for j in range(1, i):
            next_row.append(prev_row[j-1] + prev_row[j])
        next_row.append(1)
        triangle.append(next_row)
    return triangle
```

Both programs generate the same output for any positive integer `n` passed into the `pascal` function. You can choose either one based on your preference.
