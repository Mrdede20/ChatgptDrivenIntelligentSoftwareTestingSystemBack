Here's the first program to achieve the intention:

```
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

Here's the second program to achieve the same intention:

```
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

Both programs use the same method name `get_factors()` and the same parameter type `n`. The first program uses a while loop to check for factors while the second program uses a for loop with the range function. The second program also uses the square root of the input as the upper limit of the range to improve efficiency.
