Program 1:

```
def wrap(text, cols):
    """
    This function takes in a long string and an integer representing the column width. 
    It breaks the string into a list of lines, each no longer than the specified column width. 
    The function ensures that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless it is necessary. 
    The original amount of spaces is preserved, and spaces at the start or end of each line are not trimmed. 
    The function returns an ordered list of strings as the output.
    """
    lines = []
    words = text.split()
    curr_line = words[0]
    for word in words[1:]:
        if len(curr_line) + 1 + len(word) > cols:
            lines.append(curr_line)
            curr_line = word
        else:
            curr_line += ' ' + word
    lines.append(curr_line)
    return lines
```

Program 2: 

```
import textwrap

def wrap(text, cols):
    """
    This function takes in a long string and an integer representing the column width. 
    It breaks the string into a list of lines, each no longer than the specified column width. 
    The function ensures that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless it is necessary. 
    The original amount of spaces is preserved, and spaces at the start or end of each line are not trimmed. 
    The function returns an ordered list of strings as the output.
    """
    lines = textwrap.wrap(text, width=cols)
    return lines
```

Both programs achieve the same purpose and have the same method name and parameter types. Program 1 uses a for loop to iterate through each word in the text and builds the lines as it goes. Program 2 is a bit more concise, using the `textwrap` module to wrap the text for us. Program 2 is likely to be faster and more efficient, but Program 1 provides more control over how the text is wrapped.
