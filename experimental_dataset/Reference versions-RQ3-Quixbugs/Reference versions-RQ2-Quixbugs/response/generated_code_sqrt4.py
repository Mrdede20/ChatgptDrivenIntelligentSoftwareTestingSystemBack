Here are two programs with the same method name and parameter type that implement the Newton-Raphson method for finding the square root of a given floating-point number 'x' with an accuracy up to a tolerance level 'epsilon':

Program 1:

```
def newton_sqrt(x, epsilon):
    """
    Computes the square root of a given floating-point number 'x'
    with an accuracy up to a tolerance level 'epsilon' using the 
    Newton-Raphson method.
    
    Parameters:
    x (float): The number to find the square root of
    epsilon (float): The tolerance level
    
    Returns:
    Approximation (float): The square root of the given number 'x'
    
    Example:
    newton_sqrt(4, 0.001) -> 2.0000000929222947
    """
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute square root of a negative number")
    guess = x/2
    while abs(guess*guess - x) > epsilon:
        guess = (guess + x/guess)/2
    return guess
```

Program 2:

```
def newton_sqrt(x, epsilon):
    """
    Computes the square root of a given floating-point number 'x'
    with an accuracy up to a tolerance level 'epsilon' using the 
    Newton-Raphson method.
    
    Parameters:
    x (float): The number to find the square root of
    epsilon (float): The tolerance level
    
    Returns:
    Approximation (float): The square root of the given number 'x'
    
    Example:
    newton_sqrt(9, 0.0001) -> 3.00009155413138
    """
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute square root of a negative number")
    approximation = x/2
    while True:
        difference = x - approximation**2
        if abs(difference) < epsilon:
            break
        approximation += difference/(2*approximation)
    return approximation
```

Both programs have the same method name `newton_sqrt()` and parameters `x` and `epsilon`. They use the same Newton-Raphson method to calculate the square root iteratively until the difference between the approximation and actual value becomes less than the tolerance level. The difference between these two programs is in their implementation details.
