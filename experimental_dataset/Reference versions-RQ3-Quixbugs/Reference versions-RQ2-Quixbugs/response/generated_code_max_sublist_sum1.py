Here are two possible implementations of the Maximum Sublist Sum problem:

Implementation 1: using Kadane's algorithm

```python
def maximum_sublist_sum(nums):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray within a given list of integers using Kadane's algorithm.

    Args:
    - nums: a list of integers

    Returns:
    - the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray
    """
    max_so_far = max_ending_here = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        max_ending_here = max(nums[i], max_ending_here + nums[i])
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
``` 

Implementation 2: using dynamic programming

```python
def maximum_sublist_sum(nums):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray within a given list of integers using dynamic programming.

    Args:
    - nums: a list of integers

    Returns:
    - the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray
    """
    dp = [nums[0]] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
    return max(dp)
``` 

Both implementations have the same method name and take a list of integers as input. They both return the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray within the list. The first implementation uses Kadane's algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n), while the second implementation uses dynamic programming which also has a time complexity of O(n).
