Here are two programs that achieve the intention of creating a function named `wrap` that takes in two arguments, `text` and `cols`, and breaks down the `text` into lines no longer than the `cols`:

Program 1: Using a while loop and string slicing
```python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        # find last space within cols limit
        last_space = text[:cols].rfind(" ")
        # if no space found, break the word
        if last_space == -1:
            last_space = cols
        # add the line to list and remove it from text
        lines.append(text[:last_space])
        text = text[last_space+1:]
    # add the remaining text to a line
    lines.append(text)
    return lines
```

Program 2: Using the textwrap module
```python
import textwrap

def wrap(text, cols):
    return textwrap.wrap(text, cols)
```

Both programs use the same function name and parameter types, and accomplish the same intention. Program 1 uses a while loop and string slicing to break down the `text`, while Program 2 uses the built-in `textwrap` module. Program 2 is more succinct and doesn't require writing any extra code, while Program 1 can be useful if you need more control over the line breaks or want to customize the code further.
