Program 1:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 1:
        return [[i] for i in range(a, b+1)]
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b-k+2):
        for seq in subsequences(i+1, b, k-1):
            ret.append([i] + seq)
    return ret
```

Program 2:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 1:
        return [[i] for i in range(a, b+1)]
    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b-k+2):
        ret += [[i] + seq for seq in subsequences(i+1, b, k-1)]
    return ret
```

Both of these programs achieve the desired functionality using the same method name and parameter types. The difference is in how the results are collected in the `for` loop. Program 1 appends each new subsequence to the `ret` list, while Program 2 uses the `+=` operator to concatenate the list of new subsequences to the existing `ret` list. Both approaches work fine and should have similar performance, so it comes down to personal preference.
