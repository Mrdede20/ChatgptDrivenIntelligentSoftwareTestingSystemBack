Program 1:

```
from collections import defaultdict

def floyd_warshall(num_nodes, edges):
    # create a defaultdict with infinity as default value
    path_lengths = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    
    # set the length of the shortest path between each node and itself as 0
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        path_lengths[(i, i)] = 0
    
    # set the length of paths between nodes as given in the input dictionary
    for (u, v), dist in edges.items():
        path_lengths[(u, v)] = dist
    
    # compute shortest path lengths through all possible intermediate nodes
    for k in range(num_nodes):
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(num_nodes):
                path_lengths[(i, j)] = min(path_lengths[(i, j)], path_lengths[(i, k)] + path_lengths[(k, j)])
    
    return path_lengths
```

Program 2:

```
from collections import defaultdict

def floyd_warshall(num_nodes, edges):
    # create a defaultdict with infinity as default value
    path_lengths = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    
    # set the length of the shortest path between each node and itself as 0
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        path_lengths[(i, i)] = 0
    
    # set the length of paths between nodes as given in the input dictionary
    for edge, dist in edges.items():
        path_lengths[edge] = dist
    
    # compute shortest path lengths through all possible intermediate nodes
    for k in range(num_nodes):
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(num_nodes):
                path_lengths[(i, j)] = min(path_lengths[(i, j)], path_lengths[(i, k)] + path_lengths[(k, j)])
    
    return path_lengths
```

Both programs have the same method name and parameter type. They use a defaultdict to initialize the path length to infinity and assume that there are no negative-length cycles in the input graph. The difference between the two programs is in how they process the edges dictionary. In program 1, the edges dictionary is processed using `(u, v)` key-value pairs, while in program 2, the edges dictionary is processed using `(start_node, end_node)` tuples as keys.
