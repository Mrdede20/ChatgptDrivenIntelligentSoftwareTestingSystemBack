Here is the first program:

```
def levenshtein_distance(source, target):
    if len(source) == 0:
        return len(target)
    elif len(target) == 0:
        return len(source)
    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target[1:])
    else:
        deletion = levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target)
        insertion = levenshtein_distance(source, target[1:])
        substitution = levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target[1:])
        return min(deletion, insertion, substitution) + 1
```

Here is the second program that uses memoization to optimize the Levenshtein distance calculation:

```
def levenshtein_distance(source, target, memo={}):
    if (source, target) in memo:
        return memo[(source, target)]
    if len(source) == 0:
        memo[(source, target)] = len(target)
    elif len(target) == 0:
        memo[(source, target)] = len(source)
    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        memo[(source, target)] = levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target[1:], memo)
    else:
        deletion = levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target, memo)
        insertion = levenshtein_distance(source, target[1:], memo)
        substitution = levenshtein_distance(source[1:], target[1:], memo)
        memo[(source, target)] = min(deletion, insertion, substitution) + 1
    return memo[(source, target)]
```

Both of these programs achieve the same intention of calculating the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The first program uses recursion to break down the comparison into smaller substrings and then calculates the distance based on three options: removing the first character of the target string, removing the first character of the source string, or changing the first character of the source string to match the first character of the target string. The second program uses memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. By using memoization, the second program can be more efficient for large strings or when calculating the distance multiple times with different targets.
