Sure, here are two Python programs that generate all possible subsets of a given list (power set) without duplicates, including the empty set and the original set itself using the same method name and parameter type.

Program 1:

```
def powerset(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return [[]]
    first = arr[0]
    rest = arr[1:]
    subsets = powerset(rest)
    new_subsets = [subset + [first] for subset in subsets]
    return subsets + new_subsets
```

In this program, we first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return a list containing only the empty list as its element. Otherwise, we divide the input list into two parts, where the first part is a single element 'first' and the second part is the remaining list 'rest'. We then recursively generate all possible subsets of 'rest' using the same 'powerset' function and combine them with the 'first' element in all possible ways. The new subsets are then added to the existing subsets, and the result is returned.

Program 2:

```
def powerset(arr):
    def _powerset(i):
        if i == len(arr):
            return [[]]
        subsets = _powerset(i + 1)
        new_subsets = [subset + [arr[i]] for subset in subsets if subset + [arr[i]] not in subsets]
        return subsets + new_subsets
    return _powerset(0)
```

In this program, we define a helper function '_powerset' which takes an index 'i' as input and recursively generates all possible subsets of the input list starting from index 'i'. The base case for recursion is when the index 'i' reaches the length of the input list, in which case we return a list containing only the empty list as its element. Otherwise, we first recursively generate all possible subsets of the remaining list starting from index 'i+1' and store them in 'subsets'. Next, we go through each subset in 'subsets' and generate a new subset by combining it with the current element at index 'i'. We only add the new subset to the result if it is not already in 'subsets'. The new subsets are then added to the existing subsets, and the result is returned.

Both programs generate all possible subsets of a given list (power set) without duplicates, including the empty set and the original set itself using the same method name 'powerset' and parameter type 'arr'.
