Program 1:

```python
def bellman_ford_algorithm(graph, source):
    weight_by_node = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    weight_by_node[source] = 0
    
    for _ in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
                if weight_by_node[node] + weight < weight_by_node[neighbor]:
                    weight_by_node[neighbor] = weight_by_node[node] + weight
                    
    return weight_by_node
```

Program 2:

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def bellman_ford_algorithm(graph, source):
    weight_by_node = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    weight_by_node[source] = 0
    
    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
                if weight_by_node[node] + weight < weight_by_node[neighbor]:
                    weight_by_node[neighbor] = weight_by_node[node] + weight
    
    return weight_by_node
```


Both programs have the same method name `bellman_ford_algorithm` and take two arguments: `graph`, which is a dictionary representing the directed graph, and `source`, which is the starting node for the algorithm. Both programs initialize the `weight_by_node` dictionary with float infinity for all nodes except the starting node, which is initialized with 0. They then iterate over the edges of the graph and update the stored weights if a smaller weight is found. Finally, they return the `weight_by_node` dictionary, which contains the minimum path weights to each node from the given source node. 

Program 2 uses `defaultdict` from collections to create `weight_by_node` and provide a default value of `float('inf')`. This simplifies the initialization of the dictionary and saves a couple of lines of code.
