Here are two Python programs that implement the Newton-Raphson method for finding the square root of a given number 'x' with a certain level of precision, specified by 'epsilon'. Both programs use the same method name and parameter type, as required. 

Program 1: Using a while loop

```
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    """
    Takes two inputs- 'x' and 'epsilon' and returns the approximate square root of 'x' with a tolerance level of 'epsilon'.
    """
    assert x >= 1 and epsilon > 0

    approx = x
    while abs(approx**2 - x) > epsilon:
        approx = (approx + x/approx) / 2

    return approx
```

The above program uses a while loop to repeatedly update the approximation of the square root until the difference between the current approximation and the actual square root is within the tolerance level 'epsilon'.

Program 2: Using recursion

```
def sqrt(x, epsilon, approx=None):
    """
    Takes two inputs- 'x' and 'epsilon' and returns the approximate square root of 'x' with a tolerance level of 'epsilon'.
    """
    assert x >= 1 and epsilon > 0

    if approx == None:
        approx = x

    if abs(approx**2 - x) <= epsilon:
        return approx
    else:
        return sqrt(x, epsilon, (approx + x/approx) / 2)
```

The above program uses recursion to repeatedly update the approximation of the square root until the difference between the current approximation and the actual square root is within the tolerance level 'epsilon'. The initial value of 'approx' is set to 'x' when the function is first called.
