Here are two Python programs that achieve the given intention using the same method name and parameter type.

Program 1:

```python
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        else:
            i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

Program 2:

```python
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return [i] + get_factors(n//i)
    return [n]
```

Both programs use the same naive trial division method to find the prime factors of the given number. They first check if the number is 1, in which case they return an empty list as 1 is not a prime number. For all other numbers, they loop through all the numbers from 2 to square root of n and check if n is divisible by i. If n is divisible, then they recursively call the same function for n//i and return the list concatenating value of i with the returned list. If n is not divisible by any number i, then they return an empty list.

The first program uses a while loop whereas the second program uses a for loop to iterate through the possible factors. The second program also uses the square root method to reduce the number of iterations needed to find the prime factors. Both programs return the prime factors in a sorted order.
