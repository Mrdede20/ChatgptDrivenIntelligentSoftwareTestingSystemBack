Program 1:

```python
def find_primes(max):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, max+1):
        is_prime = True
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

Program 2:

```python
def find_primes(max):
    primes = []
    candidates = [True] * (max+1)
    for num in range(2, max+1):
        if candidates[num]:
            primes.append(num)
            for multiple in range(num*num, max+1, num):
                candidates[multiple] = False
    return primes
```

Both of these programs achieve the same intention of finding and returning a list of all prime numbers up to and including a given upper bound `max`, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The second program uses a more optimized approach by using a boolean list `candidates` to keep track of all the potential prime numbers up to `max`, and only iterating through the multiples of each prime number instead of all numbers. This reduces the overall number of iterations and improves efficiency.
