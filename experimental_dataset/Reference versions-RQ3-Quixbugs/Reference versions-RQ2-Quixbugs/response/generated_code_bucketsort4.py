Program 1:

```
def bucket_sort(arr, k):
    buckets = [[] for _ in range(k)]
    for val in arr:
        index = val // k
        buckets[index].append(val)
    result = []
    for bucket in buckets:
        if bucket:
            bucket.sort()
            result += bucket
    return result
```

Program 2:

```
def bucket_sort(arr, k):
    buckets = {}
    for i in range(k):
        buckets[i] = []
    for val in arr:
        index = val // k
        if index not in buckets:
            buckets[index] = []
        buckets[index].append(val)
    result = []
    for i in range(k):
        if i in buckets:
            buckets[i].sort()
            result += buckets[i]
    return result
```

Both programs have the same time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the range of input values. Program 1 uses a list of lists to represent the buckets, while Program 2 uses a dictionary. Program 1 may have better space efficiency as it only creates lists for non-empty buckets, while Program 2 pre-allocates a dictionary with k empty lists.
