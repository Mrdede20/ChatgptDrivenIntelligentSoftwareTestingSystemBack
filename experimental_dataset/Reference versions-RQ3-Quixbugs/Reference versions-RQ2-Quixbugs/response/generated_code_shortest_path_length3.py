Here are two programs that implement Dijkstra's algorithm using Fibonacci heap.

First program:

```python
import heapq
from math import inf

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value=None, successor=None, successors=[], predecessors=[], incoming_nodes=[], outgoing_nodes=[]):
        self.value = value
        self.successor = successor
        self.successors = successors
        self.predecessors = predecessors
        self.incoming_nodes = incoming_nodes
        self.outgoing_nodes = outgoing_nodes

    def successor(self):
        return self.successor

    def successors(self):
        return self.successors

    def predecessors(self):
        return self.predecessors 

def dijkstra(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):
    distances = {node: inf for node in length_by_edge.keys()}
    distances[startnode] = 0
    heap = [(0, startnode)]
    visited = set()

    while heap:
        (distance, node) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        if node == goalnode:
            return distance
        for successor in node.successors:
            new_distance = distances[node] + length_by_edge[(node, successor)]
            if new_distance < distances[successor]:
                distances[successor] = new_distance
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_distance, successor))
    
    return inf
```

Second program:

```python
import heapq
from math import inf

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value=None, successor=None, successors=[], predecessors=[], incoming_nodes=[], outgoing_nodes=[]):
        self.value = value
        self.successor = successor
        self.successors = successors
        self.predecessors = predecessors
        self.incoming_nodes = incoming_nodes
        self.outgoing_nodes = outgoing_nodes

    def successor(self):
        return self.successor

    def successors(self):
        return self.successors

    def predecessors(self):
        return self.predecessors 

def dijkstra(length_by_edge, startnode, goalnode):
    distances = {node: inf for node in length_by_edge.keys()}
    distances[startnode] = 0
    heap = [(0, startnode)]
    visited = set()

    while heap:
        (distance, node) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        if node == goalnode:
            return distance
        for successor in node.successors:
            new_distance = distances[node] + length_by_edge[(node, successor)]
            if new_distance < distances[successor]:
                distances[successor] = new_distance
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_distance, successor))
    
    return inf
```

Both programs have the same method name (`dijkstra`) and the same parameter type as specified. The provided `Node` class has been used in both implementations of the algorithm.
