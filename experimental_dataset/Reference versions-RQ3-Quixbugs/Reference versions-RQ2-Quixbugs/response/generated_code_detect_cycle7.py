Program 1:
```python
def detect_cycle(head):
    if not head:
        return False
    
    slow, fast = head, head
    
    while fast and fast.successor:
        slow = slow.successor
        fast = fast.successor.successor
        
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    return False
```

Program 2:
```python
def detect_cycle(head):
    if not head:
        return False
    
    slow, fast = head, head.successor
    
    while fast is not None:
        if fast == slow:
            return True
        
        slow = slow.successor
        if fast.successor is not None:
            fast = fast.successor.successor
        else:
            break
    
    return False
```
Both these implementations use the same method name `detect_cycle` and the same parameter `head`. The first implementation moves both pointers one and two steps respectively, while the second implementation moves both pointers one step and two steps respectively. If there is a cycle in the linked list, both implementations will return `True`, otherwise they will return `False`.
