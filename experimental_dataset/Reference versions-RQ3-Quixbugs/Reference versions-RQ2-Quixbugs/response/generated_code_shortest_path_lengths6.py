Program 1: 

```
def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    shortest_paths = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            shortest_paths[(i,j)] = length_by_edge.get((i,j), float('inf'))
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if shortest_paths[(i,j)] > shortest_paths[(i,k)] + shortest_paths[(k,j)]:
                    shortest_paths[(i,j)] = shortest_paths[(i,k)] + shortest_paths[(k,j)]
    return shortest_paths
```
Program 2: 

```
def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    shortest_paths = {(i,j):length_by_edge.get((i,j), float('inf')) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)}
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if shortest_paths[(i,j)] > shortest_paths[(i,k)] + shortest_paths[(k,j)]:
                    shortest_paths[(i,j)] = shortest_paths[(i,k)] + shortest_paths[(k,j)]
    return shortest_paths
```

Both programs take the same parameters and return the shortest path lengths between every ordered pair of nodes in the graph. Program 2 uses dictionary comprehension to create the initial `shortest_paths` dictionary, whereas Program 1 uses a nested loop to achieve the same thing. Other than that, they both have the same algorithm for updating the shortest path lengths using dynamic programming.
