Program 1:

```
def flatten(nested_list):
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            yield from flatten(item)
        else:
            yield item
```

Program 2:

```
def flatten(nested_list):
    for item in nested_list:
        if type(item) == list:
            yield from flatten(item)
        else:
            yield item
```

Both programs implement the same `flatten` function that takes in a nested list as input and yields a generator for the input's non-list objects. They both use a recursive approach that iterates over each element in the input list, and if an element is itself a list, calls the `flatten` function again on that sublist, otherwise yields the element.
