Here are two programs that achieve the intention of implementing the QuickSelect algorithm:

Program 1:

```
def quickselect(lst, k):
    if len(lst) == 1:
        return lst[0]

    pivot = lst[0]
    below = [elem for elem in lst[1:] if elem < pivot]
    above = [elem for elem in lst[1:] if elem >= pivot]

    if len(below) == k:
        return pivot
    elif len(below) > k:
        return quickselect(below, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(above, k - len(below) - 1)
```

Program 2:

```
def quickselect(lst, k):
    if len(lst) == 1:
        return lst[0]

    pivot = lst[0]
    below = []
    above = []

    for elem in lst[1:]:
        if elem < pivot:
            below.append(elem)
        else:
            above.append(elem)

    if len(below) == k:
        return pivot
    elif len(below) > k:
        return quickselect(below, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(above, k - len(below) - 1)
```

Both programs take in a list of integers and an integer k, which represents the kth element we want to find (0-indexed). They use the QuickSelect algorithm to efficiently find the kth element in the list. The main difference between the two programs is how they create the sub-lists of elements below and above the pivot. Program 1 uses a list comprehension, while Program 2 uses a for loop and two separate lists. However, both programs accomplish the same thing and will produce the same output.
