Sure! Here are two options to implement Kruskal's algorithm:

Option 1:

```
def kruskal(weight_by_edge):
    edges = sorted(weight_by_edge.keys(), key=lambda x: weight_by_edge[x]) # sort edges by weight
    group_by_node = {node: [node] for node in weight_by_edge.keys()} # initialize each node in its own group
    mst = set() # initialize empty set of edges

    for edge in edges:
        node1, node2 = edge
        group1, group2 = group_by_node[node1], group_by_node[node2]
        if group1 != group2: # if nodes not in the same group (i.e. edge does not create cycle)
            mst.add(edge) # add edge to the minimum spanning tree
            group = group1 + group2 # merge groups
            for node in group:
                group_by_node[node] = group # update group_by_node
    return mst
```

Option 2:

```
def kruskal(weight_by_edge):
    edges = sorted(weight_by_edge.keys(), key=lambda x: weight_by_edge[x]) # sort edges by weight
    group_by_node = {node: {node} for node in weight_by_edge.keys()} # initialize each node in its own group
    mst = set() # initialize empty set of edges

    def find(node):
        return next(group for group in group_by_node.values() if node in group) # find the group that the node belongs to

    for edge in edges:
        node1, node2 = edge
        group1, group2 = find(node1), find(node2)
        if group1 != group2: # if nodes not in the same group (i.e. edge does not create cycle)
            mst.add(edge) # add edge to the minimum spanning tree
            group1 |= group2 # merge groups
            for node in group2:
                group_by_node[node] = group1 # update group_by_node
    return mst
```

Both options take in a dictionary `weight_by_edge` which represents the weight of each edge in the graph, and returns a set of edges which together form the minimum spanning tree of the graph. The second option relies on a helper function `find` to find the group that a node belongs to. The first option updates `group_by_node` by merging lists, while the second one updates it by merging sets.
