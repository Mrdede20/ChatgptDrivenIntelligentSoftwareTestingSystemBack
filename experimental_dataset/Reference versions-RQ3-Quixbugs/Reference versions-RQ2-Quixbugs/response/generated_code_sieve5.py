Program 1:

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(max:int) -> list:
    primes = []
    numbers = list(range(2, max+1))
    while numbers:
        p = numbers.pop(0)
        primes.append(p)
        numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % p != 0]
    return primes
```

Program 2:

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(max:int) -> list:
    primes = []
    is_prime = [True] * (max+1)
    for n in range(2, max+1):
        if is_prime[n]:
            primes.append(n)
            for multiple in range(n*n, max+1, n):
                is_prime[multiple] = False
    return primes
```

Both programs achieve the same intention of generating a list of all prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Program 1 uses a list to keep track of possible primes and eliminates composite numbers by iterating through and checking each possible prime. Program 2 uses a boolean list to mark numbers as prime or composite, and eliminates composite numbers by marking their multiples in the list.
