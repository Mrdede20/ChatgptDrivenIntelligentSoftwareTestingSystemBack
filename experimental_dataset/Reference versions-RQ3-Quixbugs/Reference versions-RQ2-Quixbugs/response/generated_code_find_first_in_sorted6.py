Here are two programs that achieve this intention using the same method name and the same parameter type:

Program 1:
```
def fancy_binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

Program 2:
```
def fancy_binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            if mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1] != x:
                return mid
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

Both programs use the binary search algorithm to find the lowest index i for a given value x in a sorted list of integers. 

Program 1 finds the target element, and then it narrows down the search space to the lower half, as that is where the lowest index of the target element would be found. 

Program 2 finds the target element and checks if its index is the lowest occurrence. If yes, it returns the index; otherwise, it narrows down the search space to the lower half, where the lowest occurrence of the target element is likely to be found.
