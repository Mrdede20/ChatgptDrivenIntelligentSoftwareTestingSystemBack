Program 1:

```
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.
    
    Preconditions:
        a and b are non-negative integers
    
    Example Usage:
        gcd(10, 25) -> 5
        
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)
```

Program 2:

```
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.
    
    Preconditions:
        a and b are non-negative integers
    
    Example Usage:
        gcd(12, 18) -> 6
        
    """
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return gcd(b%a, a)
```

Both programs have the same method name `gcd` and the same input parameters `a` and `b` with integer type. They both use recursion to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers. 

Program 1 is easier to read as it clearly checks if b is equal to 0 first before entering the recursion. In contrast, program 2 first checks if a equals 0 before taking the modulo which might be somewhat confusing. However, program 2 could be faster for large values of `a` and `b`.
