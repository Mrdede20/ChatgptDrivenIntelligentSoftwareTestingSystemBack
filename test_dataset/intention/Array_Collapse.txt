You are given an array [p1,p2,…,pn], where all elements are distinct.
You can perform several (possibly zero) operations with it. In one operation, you can choose a contiguous subsegment of p and remove all elements from that subsegment, except for the minimum element on that subsegment. For example, if p=[3,1,4,7,5,2,6] and you choose the subsegment from the 3-rd element to the 6-th element, the resulting array is [3,1,2,6].
An array a is called reachable if it can be obtained from p using several (maybe zero) aforementioned operations. Calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo 998244353.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤10^4) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer n (1≤n≤3*10^5). The second line contains n distinct integers p1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤10^9).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of reachable arrays, taken modulo 998244353.
