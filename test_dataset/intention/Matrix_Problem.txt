You are given a matrix a, consisting of n rows by m columns. Each element of the matrix is equal to 0 or 1.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the matrix and replace it with either 0 or 1.

You are also given two arrays A and B (of length n and m respectively). After you perform the operations, the matrix should satisfy the following conditions:

1.the number of ones in the i-th row of the matrix should be exactly Ai for every i∈[1,n].
2.the number of ones in the j-th column of the matrix should be exactly Bj for every j∈[1,m].
Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (2≤n,m≤50).
Then n lines follow. The i-th of them contains m integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,m (0≤ai,j≤1).
The next line contains n integers A1,A2,…,An (0≤Ai≤m).
The next line contains m integers B1,B2,…,Bm (0≤Bi≤n).

Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform, or -1 if it is impossible.
