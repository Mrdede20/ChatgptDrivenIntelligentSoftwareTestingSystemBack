In this problem, you are initially given an empty multiset. You have to process two types of queries:

ADD x — add an element equal to 2^x to the multiset;
GET w — say whether it is possible to take the sum of some subset of the current multiset and get a value equal to w.
Input
The first line contains one integer m (1≤m≤10^5) — the number of queries.

Then m lines follow, each of which contains two integers ti, vi, denoting the i-th query. If ti=1, then the i-th query is ADD vi (0≤vi≤29). If ti=2, then the i-th query is GET vi (0≤vi≤10^9).

Output
For each GET query, print YES if it is possible to choose a subset with sum equal to w, or NO if it is impossible.
